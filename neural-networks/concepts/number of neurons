• Number of hidden nodes: There is 
no magic formula for selecting the 
optimum number of hidden neurons.
However, some thumb rules are 
available for calculating number of
hidden neurons. A rough
approximation can be obtained by
the geometric pyramid rule proposed
by Masters (1993). For a three layer
network with n input and m output
neurons, the hidden layer would have sqrt(m*n)
neurons.

In sum, for most problems, one could
probably get decent performance (even
without a second optimization step) by
setting the hidden layer configuration
using just two rules: (i) number of
hidden layers equals one; and (ii) the
number of neurons in that layer is the
mean of the neurons in the input and
output layers.
