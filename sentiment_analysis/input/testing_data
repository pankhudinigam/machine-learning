The picture of this phone on the site does no justice to it at all.
Features?
endless.
It's also a strong sturdy made device.
It's worth more than it's selling for.
la publicacion dice \"desbloqueado\" no fue asi, aunque regresaron 10% del costo, sigue siendo un enga\u00f1o, no queria tener que gastar en liberarlo.
!!.
I bought one of these for a Spanish speaking friend and it came with English and a few obscure Asian language interfaces so I could not give the gift because she can not read English.
You would think any S5233 international version should have Spanish as an option.
I have this phone in black for over three months now.
I was looking for a small PDA type unit that was unlocked GSM.
First let me point out that this phone was developed for the European/Asian market and is not supported by Samsung in the US.
Additionally, this phone is not supported by ATT.
The message notification would not go off after I retrieved my messages and I was receiving a cryptic text message every time I retrieved my voicemail.
ATT provided me with 2 replacement GSM chips but to no avail.
The unit has it's own failures as well.
The system to get to the digit keys when you are on the phone will drive you crazy.
Ditto for getting the speaker working or switching between callers etc.
After buying an expensive case from Hong Kong (there are not that many quality accessories available here)I will now retire it to the drawer.
Forget this model or similar units with slightly different numbers like S5233S (the actual model I bought).
This phone has gone from CA to NJ (when the Team went to help after Superstorm Sandy) and was most recently used by the Team in Liberia.
Would recommend to anyone.
I ordered this phone because of the reviews on the signal.
I live out in the country and every tracfone I had did not have a signal.
Even with this phone NO SIGNAL I have to drive down the road 1 mile to make a call or receive one.
My wife has one, she paid 9.
95 and it has 5 bars everywhere.
I paid 39.
995 for this piece of junk a complete waste of money.
Go and get a cheap basic tracfone don't waste your hard earned money on this piece of S***!!!.
it gets hang.
sometime does not work anything.
wifi is not available all the time.
its like i threw my money in the river.
I bought this phone because of a free $25 phone card that made this phone literally free.
I added about $60 for $85.
Even with casual uses, in a month the balance was near zero.
I have no idea why.
I think AT&T; charged for missed calls because I wasn't dialing any 900 numbers on it.
Also for some reason I couldn't refill even though I tried three different times.
I was eventually directed to customer service whose office was closed.
I don't blame anyone, but this company does a good job turning money away.
I needed this phone number for one more month, but they really make it hard to do business with them.
Phone wasn't so bad overall.
Clunky and plasticky.
Go with T-Mobile if you are going for prepaid phones.
Really regret not going with them in the first place.
Does not work properly.
The radio button fails every time.
It comes without the stock hard case.
It is a refurbished devicekeep away.
This phone was sold as unlocked.
Not only is is locked, it also cannot be unlocked.
So it has been a waste of money and time so far.
This is my worst Amazon purchase.
GRRRRRRRR!!!!!.
This is a nice phone.
If it had wifi I'd give it 5 stars.
The camera is nice too.
Great product!
More than what I expected.
A a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a.
Great wifi to connect to any AP, no need for data plans.
saves you money.
battery life is great.
sound quality is amazing.
Couldnt go wrong with this phone.
Loved it to the max!.
I bought one of these cases at a horse show and love it.
It is no too bulky to wear all the time, and it does not interfere with most of my daily chores.
It is slightly stretchy so it does not cut off circulation to my leg and is perfect for horse back riding.
The velcro keeps it securely closed but easy for one handed opening.
I recommend this product to everyone.
I bought this item and when arrive i see a not original box, and when we try to use no ring, no music sound, no any sound.
I place a reclamation and the saler say \" No guarantee\" PLEASE DONT BUY IT!.
The samsng phone i ordered from you would not take a program.
the teack phone people and myself spent a good two and a half weeks on the land line trying to get it to work.
Finally they gave up  and asked me to send them the phone and they would send me a replacement.
I did and they did.
They sent me a lg track phone.
it took another week and a half to program it.
I have never in my life been so flusterated at anything.
my wife amd myself owened lg phones and they both went bad within a week of each other.
She went to a local store to purchase another phone.
they in formed her that the lg,s we had is now discontinue.
so they sold her another lg with better features.
me ?
i am stuck with the same old lg phone.
I am a senior and have been concidering a jetter bug I have looked at my sister in laws and i can actually see the numbers and read and see the writting.
Do you sale jitter bugs and the pckage that support them ?
If so send me your info.
Sorry about this and beleave me i left out a lot.
like they beening track phone co
folkes cheated me or i should say shitted me me out of around 60 minutes during all of the fe- ass - co
enough of this it's upsetting me agian.
Ernest Ross.
Cannot use the phone, because battery life is lousy.
After 4 hours of standby time and maybe three calls talk time 20 minutes battery status is almost gone.
I do not recommend this phone.
I just received this product and for my surprise according with the description was completed differend (on the review says good shaped wih a tiny crack on the back 32G 3GS) went I opened the box it was completed damage all broken, the scren and the back cover, it dosent turn it on, it was 3G, 16 GB  ( And not 3GS, 32 GB working properly)  it was a complety fake for the one I purchase on line.
Then I try to contact to vendor, but he dose'nt resolve my problem with the Iphone, says  that he dosen't found the real one on his stock , and receiving just his apologies for my concern, no my money or the iphone.
DON'T PURCHASE FROM THIS GUY  !
!
!.
I will want express my disappointment over JR electronics that I bought from.
They just sent aa phone with out the manual.
Instead I was given a wrong manual.
the accessories as listed are not in the package delivered.
Please kindly send the manual to the address or I will return the phone.
I was quite satisfied with the phone.
It worked well for a couple of hours.
when I tried to make a call later the keypad refused to work!
No buttons was working.
This had put me in a terrible position because I was in so much inconvenience!
I was very disappointed in the phone and also the company that sold the item.
WOW!
THIS PHONE HAS ALL THE FEATURES THAT YOU NEED AND IT'S UNLOCKED.
I BOUGHT IT TO USE IN VENEZUELA.
IT WORKS PERFECTLY WITH ALL THE FEATURESCAMERAEMAILBROWSERVOICE DIALINGBLACKBERRY MESSANGERMEMORY CARDS SLOTVIDEO PLAYERVERY EASY TO USE.
GREAT QUALITY.
I AM VERY HAPPY.
THIS IS MY FAVORITE PHONE BUT IT HAS A HUGE ISSUE.
THE UNLOCKED PHONES, I FOUND OUT BY GOING THROUGH 8 CALLS WITH AT&T; AND PANTECH (WHO HAS AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE BY THE WAY AND OUTSOURCED) DO NOT ALLOW FOR CUSTOMIZATION OF THE MULTI-MEDIA PROFILE, UNLESS IT'S THE EXCLUSIVE AT&T; MODEL (W/LOGO ON THE DEVICE).
BASICALLY, YOU CAN BROWSE THE NET, RECEIVE AND MAKE CALLS, SEND & RECEIVE TEXTS, BUT YOU CAN not MAKE OR RECEIVE MULTI-MEDIA MESSAGES.
WHICH FREAKING SUCKS.
THEY JUST SAY ON THE PHONE \"SORRY, IT'S AN OLD UN-CUSTOMIZABLE MODEL\".
Im disapointed with the treatment given.
I ordered this item on dic 1st and still on dic 12 havent got any response of my item.
Real POOR.
posted phone was unlocked while is not ( Samsung Solstice A887 Unlocked GSM Phone - Black )plz be positive.
everywhere i search im seeing that this phone comes with the charging stand and the wireless Bluetooth headset.
but i didnt get it.
all i got was the cheap looking headphones and no charging stand.
so far that's the only disappointing thing about my purchase.
phone works great.
BUY IT USED THE PHONE TOLD ME THAT WAS IN GOOD CONDITION, BUT WHEN I RECEIVED THE PHONE WAS WORKING BUT THE CASE IN BAD CONDITION AND WELL USED FOR HIGH NOT ADVISED ME THAT WAS BROKEN SCREEN.
THINGS NOT WORTH BUYING USED.
There was no SERIOUS THIS TIME IN THE STORE THAT bids.
I didn't know there was a bb 950, isn't this a typo?Maybe you meant 9500 or 9550?Please let me know.
This product is not really ready for release: the phone shuts off without warning.
I've had the device for two weeks, and it has shut down ten or more times.
The software appears to still be in the beta stage.
This is intolerable for a business phone.
Moreover, the device was shipped with an installed memory card that contained a number of applications and 4 of the 6 installed themes.
What manufacturer installs themes and applications on the memory card?
This is just careless and sloppy.
Additionally, the battery is so tightly placed that one can't remove it with a fingernail.
One has to tap it hard upon the palm the get it out.
Things like this just show that this is not yet a properly developed business phone.
UPDATE: May 15, 2012:Shortly after the review given above, I shoved this phone into a drawer and moved on.
Periodically, however, I would remove it, update the software that Nokia continued to provide, find that the phone was still unstable, then put it back into the drawer.
About six month ago I took it out and found that there was another update: amazing, since this phone came out around mid 2009.
After that update, the phone finally became stable, and I started to use it.
A few days ago, another update came (Version 091.
033
c00.
01).
My God, Nokia is still updating after almost three years.
I now use the phone as one of my daily devices (the other is the inimitable N9).
The E52 is fantastic.
Granted, it is not for avid video watching: the screen is small.
However, it is fast, has free navigation with text-to-speech voice navigation, voip support, Skype from Nokia Store, Gravity, et al.
I notice that it is now only available as a used device.
Too bad.
It took Nokia more than two years to finally get it right - perhaps that is why they have struggled of late, yet if you need a solid, small, light-weight business phone, get this device!.
I already bought this product for since last week.
I cannot tell everything about this phone right now because at this time, the phone still in the post office place.
I don't know why Amazon choose USPS for carrying that shipping.
5 days for Amazon to fullfill the shipment, then 3-4 days for shipping to my house.
That is so ridiculous.
Tracking is also bad at always, go to USPS and it didn't show anything, go to Amazon and it said Arrival some where I don't know.
Hopefully tomorrow I can get that phone and post another review.
Well, mi cel phone is here with me!!
it\u00a8s was a very nice purchase!!
thank you so much!!.
I bought one of these cases at a horse show and love it.

I recommend this product to everyone.
I would NOT HAVE BOUGHT Rumor 2 if I'd known Rumor 2, has NO tunnel, no holes, in any corner to thread the string to hang it from a Lanyard, wrist-strap or anything!!
!I tried to return such foolish, inferior merchandise, but Virgin Mobile would not allow me to Return or anything, so live & learn, but I want anyone like me to know in advance, CANNOT ATTACH HANGING CLIP THINGS :-(.
I don't know where to start.
I purchased this phone about half a year ago from Radioshack, with an extended warranty that they refuse to honor in store.
Whenever I try to go through the warranty service they give me limited information and want to leave me without a phone for several weeks!
This pile of garbage hasn't worked right since day one!
My text messages send blank, or not at all.
I lose calls, the phone turns on by itself and has been great in aiding me to pay the bills!
I run a business with this phone, or at least I did until I started not getting calls.
the paint is peeling off of the keypad and the speaker vibrates like it's blown.
This is the second mantra I bought and every single one is a pile of garbage!
do yourself a favor and don't buy this.
I took me ages reviewing both this phone and the IPhone.
I'm a software engineer nad have access to quite a few IT friends and colleagues whom I can turn to when I need some advice.
Quite a lot have IPhones and quite a lot of them regret buying into what they say is a designed to keep you locked into an Apple money making scheme.
They also seem to have quite a lot of problems with all the models of the IPhone including the recent version which over-heats and has terrible battery life!
All say they should have gone with an Android phone.
The Hero has been voted the best phone of 2009 and I would agree!
It does exactly what it says it will do and more without any problems.
What a fantastic piece of kit that makes my life so much easier.
Excellent phone.
Holds music too (you'll need a Micro SD card).
superior sound crystal clear.
Nice size.
not too small.
has OLED outside screen.
Bluetooth.
I'M NOT HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE BECAUSE I DO NOT EVEN THE PHONE HAS COME FROM NOVEMBER 28 TO BUY IT.
I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE PHONE.
After adding a sim card, phone has worked perfectly.
No problems so far.
If your looking for a cell phone without all the bells and whistles, this is it.
Estoy sorprendida de como han calificado este celular, he leido que la camara no es buena pero menos mal no les hice caso la camara es espectacular, toma muy buenas fotos, la recomiendo, ademas es super bueno, lo unico malo que puedo decir es que la bateria no dura sino 2 dias entre tomado fotos y oyendo musica, pero de resto es fenomenal, asi que gracias nokia por este telefono.
This phone is great.
Free turn-by-turn directions anywhere in the world, the ability to have off-line maps to avoid roaming data charges, Skype, WiFi, Exchange Mail, MS Office compatibility, Microsoft Communicator, MSN, Google, Front facing camera, 3.
5mm jack for music, 16GB SD-card support, etc.
etc.
All that in a slick frame less than 100gr.
What kills me is that there is no 3G support with any of the US carriers.
These are my initial impressions.
What a fantastic piece of portable electronics!
Having looked at the iPhone, Samsung's Mystic and Solstice, and Motorola Droid I can safely say that the this Samsung i8910HD 16GB blows them all away.
What can I say.
This is the largest screen of the bunch.
And, WOW, is it spectacular!!!!
Can't wait to try a 720p movie.
Touch sensitivity was well adjusted right out of the box.
Good tactile sensationI'm still working through the apps included on the phone, so more on those at a later date.
My ringtone is no longer a 5, 10, or 20 second tone or cut that repeats.
I loaded a few of my MP3 and MP4 files onto the SDHC memory card, that I also purchased, to test the audio playback.
Just for grins, I selected 1 of those files as a ringtone.
It plays the 1st 40-45 seconds of the piece when I receive a call.
I almost hate to answer until the last second.
Now, I have to figure out what to use for the alerm clock tone.
Same goes for my wallpaper; photo files loaded onto the memory card.
Only bit of advice here is the files need to be somewhere less than 300Kb with the image well centered.
The phone warns you when the file is too large, though.
Files smaller than about 75Kb don't do the screen justice.
Oh, yeah, and for those who would take note, my ringtone and wallpaper are both from a single theme, but from different sources.
I know that's a bit much, but imagine the looks when the ringtone sounds, and you see exactly which image appears on the screen.
Texting is a breeze.
The adaptive spelling feature will take some time to adapt to me, but you can always turn it off.
The QWERTY keyboard in lanscape mode has large buttons that even those of us with fat-finger can use with ease.
Once I got the call volume turned up from 1, speaker clarity is great during calls.
No dropped calls yet.
Expensive?
Right now, yes.
1st kid on the block, the city, the county, maybe the state with 1 is satisfaction enough.
Plus - Now this is a phone.
LOL.
I got this for my father because he owns a sheet metal shop and always beats his phones up.
I was tired of replacing them for him.
This phone is indestructible and water proof.
He loves it and has already smacked it a few times and nothing went wrong.
This was a great purchase for him.
Minus - He was on Sprint and the cell needs to be on a GSM network so I had to cancel that line and add him to my AT&T; account to give him access to this unlocked phone.
The internet is a pain in the --- to get going but thank god he has NO intention of using that.
LOL.
He has enough issues just learning how to answer calls.
He is not good with technology.
I got this phone from amazon which is and international shipping website and SONIM have a triband phone on there which only works in the USA and i found that out after i called the SONIM hotline in which it has a 3 year unconditional warranty and they would not replace it with the international version for me nor change the chipset to a quadband.
Nokia 6700 SLIDE ALUMINUM Unlocked Phoneone of the equipment unlocked nokia 6700 model purchased from Amazon came through with a defect, the team lit I could not see it working or to use it.
Please tell me I should be grateful that I do in this case, I am in Venezuela and would like to know Opcon I have to make a change for this team.
The address where the product was sent to a family in Seattle.
This product look wise its superb, slim sleep, lovely.
But when it comes to functionality it sucks.
The camera quality is poor.
Here they claim it as 5 MP, whereas it is just only 3.
2 MP.
Also the phone gets heated for just a minute call (call duration: 1:25)it has become so hot.
Moreover while using the data plan as well the phone gets heated up.
The phone is not ergonomic.
You cant hold it for more than 10 minutes continuously.
This does not have HTC Sense.
You cant sync your outlook contacts.
It does not allow it.
HTC Sync software does not recognize this phone at all.
I got the chance to use the product but not yet.
Once you've had problems with gmail I tried to open.
After you start using again notify views.
Some of the phone was in spanish and misspelled.
It was really wierd.
I returned it and they covered the shipping charges to return it.
I had the Nokia 6030 for approximately 6 years and it was a good phone.
I used it primarily for making calls.
I wanted to upgrade due to the texting, picture, and MMS craze.
I purchased the Nokia N900 through Amazon and it was a problem from the first day.
Once I received it I noticed it did not have picture sending (MMS) capability.
When I called Nokia to enquire, they told me that it doesn't have that feature.
I had very bad battery life and the phone was replaced by Amazon within the first 30 days, with the same result.
I decided to keep it and live with the poor battery life.
Then the phone started doing things like the calendar would not remind me if I set it for multiple day reminders.
It started turning itself off and turning back on again and the turning control wouldn't work.
I had to scroll through all my contacts to make a call.
I contacted Nokia to get the phone repaired to no avail.
I sent this phone in four times and they sent a replacement twice with the same results.
I would not recommend this phone to anyone.
I will not buy another Nokia product EVER; this is based on the POOR customer service I received from them.
Just my two cent.
Advertising on this phone on Parade Magazine has misleading information aimed clearly at the cell phone ignorant.
It says \"911 Access Free\"  but ALL CELL PHONES have to provide this by law.
It says \"Long Distance Call no additional charge\" but this is true of ALL cell phones.
From other reviews, I gather that even the \"nationwide coverage\" isn't true.
All phones with voice dial don't charge for it.
please, the only thing this phone has going for it is big numbers and operator assistance (see other reviews for this issue).
And it is pricy.
What a shame.
the need is there for very elderly non-technical people, but this phone doesn't do much for them either.
By the way, the company firstSTREET has the slogan \"for Boomers and Beyond\", trust me, Boomers wouldn't be seen dead with this phone.
They are the first tech literates and use the iPhone or a nice cheap TracPhone, as should you!.
I ordered this phone to replace the same model that I had owned for 5 years.
Very pleased with phone and quick delivery.
-Camera quality simply sucks+Processor is really fast-Landscape screen is somehow inconvenient+The size of the phone is pretty small-The Apps.
I don't know, not so user-friendly as Symbian+The pen is just cute :))-It's hard to open the back or to take out the battery+Love the box =)).
I regret a lot buying this phone, this is not good at all.
freezing screen, mess up touch, not good for internet service.
now its broke cuz the toucg is mess up you have to squeeze it all the time so that you can at least type something.
it made me so nervous in a point l squeezed to hard and broke the screen now l put it in trash can to throw it away.
l lost my money.
Please peopel spay away from that phone cus its gonna drive you crazy.
The best way to describe this phone and the NET10 service is \"OK\".
The phone part is pretty good, but some other aspects are frustrating.
Tech support was accessible, and trying hard to be helpful, but I had difficulty communicating with them.
(I'm guessing support is in India
)
They answered the phone as TracPhone.
The phone itself has had some intermittent problems with turning on.
Occasionally it seems to get uncooperative and not want to turn on - a few minutes later it works.
The Micro SD card does not work at all.
As other reviewers have pointed out, it is very particular about which SD card to recognize.
My SanDisk 2GB is not one of the ones that work.
The camera was pretty good.
The browser button is prominent, and it's easy to press it inadvertently.
I don't use this feature, and it is impossible to disable.
The message when you press the browser button is \"1.
00 deducted\" - I think this means 1 minute, not 1 dollar (I hope).
The phone service and coverage itself has been good for me.
The price per-minute is a good value.
ES UN TELEFONO CON MUCHAS FUNCIONES.
NAVEGACION, REDES SOCIALES, GRAN CAMARA, GRAN CAPACIDAD DE MEMORIA.
EN FIN UN GRAN MOVIL SE LOS RECOMIENDO.
I bought two of this item, and receive another model of phone, despite confirming by phone that would receive the correct item.
it has everything i was looking for.
the only thing i miss it's the language it only come in english and the camera is good but if it would has better focus and flah led it would be totally great.
THIS PHONE IS NO GOOD.
TOUCH SCREEN IS NOT WORKING.
I TOUCH SCREEN, BUT ALL THE TIME PUSH THE DIFFERENT PLACE.
I NEED TO RETURN.
I was well pleased with the customer service they were formal and to the point and very helpful things that most others lack.
Will consider purchasing from them again.
Bought it for my self then gave it to my mom since it doesnt work on gsm 850 , and where I am thats the only network AT&T; works on, but it is a gorgeous phone, buy it if you have tmobile.
I bought it as a new.
But seens to be second hand.
Can't talk with the screen closed.
Because sounds like it people is talking by the speaker.
I'm so loving this Bold2, intuitive, great apps and 3rd party apps for just about anything.
My boss says he's bored of his iPhone and wishes to upgrade to a Blackberry Bold 9700 -I say go for it!.
Great phone.
has keyboard.
Touchscreen.
Wifi.
almost everything needed.
Also a market place to download application.
Better then the x1A ok upgrade if you are upgrading from the x1.
I love this Blackberry phone, but I've been experiencing a bit of a problem with getting it to ring when calls are coming in.
I ordered this phone because I wanted a white one and the newer version that I probably would have gotten otherwise (The Curve) did not come in white.
This ones a little bigger, but I really still like it.
It's just taking me awhile to adjust to a phone that has so many capabilities.
I hope it lasts a long time, because that's how long I plan on keeping it.
iPhone 3gs is far better than this phone.
Although Apple has only been in the smart phone market for about 3 years but I think they are doing a far better job designing the user interface and etc for the iPhone.
I wanted to try this phone out and see if Nokia is still as user friendly as it was.
Sadly it is not at all, compared to the iPhone.
I think there's too much junks and there's probably a huge learning curve for using the phone.
As for the iPhone, I feel like most people even infants would know how to play and navigate around it, the interface is fairly simple.
If you have a chance to get the iPhone 3gs at a discounted price, it is a much better phone than this.
Even android OS beats the OS they have on the E72.
If I am not mistaken Nokia discontinue the Symbian OS after this phone and focus on their Maemo or something like that.
This device may look great, and have a lot of features, however, battery life is terrible, I have to charge it twice a day, and software development fot this phone is very poor.
does not have msn live messenger support.
and now, flash player is outdated, and they are not planning on doing an update for this phone, which means that you can not watch facebook youtube videos.
and other webpages.
so if you get this phone, you will get stuck with a machine that nokia left to rott.
I bought it, and I am really dissapointed.
you should better get an N97.
I wish I had.
Phone is great and looks nice , but I cannot use it on my Sprint service carrier.
I would like to return it, have no use for the phone at this time.
My last phone was Motorola and I had a very difficult time getting a good, consistent signal.
A lot of call were dropped and a lot of searching for bars occurred.
I have not had to do so with this phone.
While it may be also due to switching Sprint to Verizon, I get a good signal almost everywhere even in large buildings (sometimes).
I got this phone because it was the freebie offered when I started Verizon.
I don't expect a lot from phones.
Just be able to make calls and not drop them.
It does all that fairly well.
As far as extras, it has no built in games (that I could find at least) and no stop watch.
It does have a camera.
I have used it occasionally.
The pictures are not that great from it.
There are probably other gizmos too that I'm not aware of.
My one major complaint are the side buttons which tend to get pressed a lot if you have other stuff in your pocket.
Not sure how but some voice recognition dialing voiced menu comes up which is annoying because it does it even if the ringer is set to vibrate.
May be a way to turn that off but I'm not aware of it.
I had this phone before I had the one I was currently using at the time, but once that died, I decided to go back to my old phone, the Samsung T-819.
This phone is great, and I was not disappointed at all.
It was everything I remember it to be.
El equipo parace ser recostruido o OEM ya que el cargador es Motorola, ademas del estuche que no es original Blackberry.
/ Is a Cel Phone OEM or refurbished because  not have the original chager and the case is motorola.
Please Beware.
The LG 1500 is amazingly small and easy to carry and has a clean connection that is better than I am used to.
If it had Blue Tooth it would be perfect!.
This phone looks great and the system works fine but the touch screen is horrible.
I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone.
I try using it for a couple of days and I got really annoyed using it.
The phone feels cheap and the \"unlock button\" is in a very inconvenience spot and every time you want to unlock it you have to slide it down, which by the way it also feels really cheap.
For the price I don't think this phone is worth it.
I admit that this phone is inferior to many smart-phones that are currently on the market.
Those all, however, require a data plan to use.
If you are like me and want a quality phone without having to pay for a data plan then this is the phone for you.
I have been using a BlackBerry Pearl for the last 6 years, so I am pretty familiar with its pros and cons.
Pros:-Modified qwerty keyboard.
While it is not a full qwerty (most of the buttons share two letters) I only commonly run across one mix up (\"see\" and \"are\").
That is a HUGE improvement over 9 key.
-A smart phone quality calendar.
-Very good media player-Bluetooth-Great Address book options.
-Unlimited text inbox space; not the 250-500 text limit that virtually all phones have.
-Many text search options.
Great for when you are looking for that text you need but can't remember when you got it or who sent it.
-Voice dialing-Fits very well into a pocket-Can set any size file as a ringtone, alarm, etc.
I could go onCons:-The camera and video camera are not very good.
I understand that there are people for whom a phone camera is more important than a calendar or address book or wifi then this is not the phone for you.
-Much like a roller ball mouse, every year or so the track ball needs to be cleaned.
There are many tutorials online that explain how this should be done.
Once cleaned it works like new.
-The headphone jack is smaller than is standard for headphones.
If you want the standard 3.
5mm jack then you probably want to upgrade to the 8120 or 8130.
I have used many many phones, but this is far and away the best NON-SMART phone I have ever used.
Ever.
A person cannot have an environmental conscience and buy this single-use piece of gadgetry.
We all have cellphones these days, and last I checked, they were pretty good for texting.
This has got to be the dumbest product to come out this year.
Hundreds of tons of electronic gadgets make their way through the waste-stream each year, we don't need more of this kind of stuff.
If you love twitter so much that you need a special device to carry around with you along with your phone just for twittering.
you need a life.
I find this phone to have all needed in a cell phone with a lot of ease in use!.
hey thanks for the phone it was nice doing business with you hopin too see more itwms from you as well.
This is a quality phone that functions well.
It has a good tutorial on how to use the different features that is easy to use and understand and you can pull it up on screen at any time.
I have big hands so the 4\" length is great for me.
I am very pleased with the phone and would recommend it to anyone.
This Has The Best Sound, And I Can Here All Calls Better Than My Flip-phone.
Thanks For A Great Product, I Like The Extras That It Has For Internet and Alarms.
Thanks Again.
This mobile phone has camera 5 MP and it's light as I think this is the only features it hasThe text message for non-english doesn't recieved completely (it gives me \"some text missing\" if it's more than 70 letters),I contacted Nokia they didn't do anything(they demonstrate that thay didn't understand the problem)two times the company changed the motherboard because the bluetooth stop working.
also no programs for this phone,also no ovi map for it.
now before few days it starts hanging when I open the gallery.
you can not open more than a program at a time.
you can not marked many contacts then put them in a group.
should be one by onethis is worst phone I bought.
I waste my money  :(.
I like the actual phone, but the person I bought it off off left all their text messages and contacts in it.
Then I found out it will not let me send pictures or let me online without a wifi connection.
Also, the vibrate does not work.
So people really need to say this in the description before someone buys it and gets angry.
The Nokia 2700 is a phone for the Asian Market and you cannot use it in the Spanish language.
After I bought it I contacted Nokia about this problem and was told that I could not use it in Spanish.
I contacted Amazon who told me to contact the seller MobileCityOnline and neither one solved my problem.
Conclusion: I will not buy anymore phones or electronics on line since I will not be guarantee that they will work for me in Spanish.
I needed to replace my old LG because the screen went dark so I ordered this replacement.
These guys were very helpful.
I had an issue with the battery and they sent me another very quickly.
Response to emails was fast.
We are an HP Product Brand Loyalist and was excited to receive this HP Palm Pre plus as branded and described here at amazon.
com and even paid extra for it to be delivered right away (one-day delivery).
When I opened the box and inspected it.
it was not in anyway an authentic HP!
We were really disappointed!.
If you're looking for a DECT VOIP phone system, there are a number of choices out there, and they're tough to decide between based on the ads alone.
We'd been using a few Snom M3s, and while they worked, they felt like cheap, flimsy toys.
Based on positive experiences with Panasonic telephone products in the past, we bough this unit plus a few spare handsets, and have been very happy with the result.
The units are solid, fit your hand well, and the audio is excellent.
Though the screen is monochrome (unlike the color screen on the Snoms), its bigger, clearer, and visible over a wider viewing angle, making for a more positive experience.
Configuration to talk to our Asterix/Raspbx system went quickly, even including installing a telephone directory file.
One minor annoyance is that (presumably for security reasons) the web configuration interface times out and has to be reset from a handset.
But once you know this, dealing with it is no big deal.
Bottom line - we're very happy with our choice.
the phone is great but there is no instructions with it.
it is easy too use it has a lot of good features.
so i just received this phone in great condition!
idk how the other 1 star reviewers got bad phones.
mine is great only thing is the wifi dont really need it wouldve preferred 3g but amazing phone love it!
did come in 2 days late.
but it was worth it.
This is an awesome phone, and a great guy to deal with.
He took his own time to take pics of the phone just for me, and was very helpful.
Great buy!.
Llego como se esperaba, Arrived as spected.
Inicialmente el producto llego bloqueado, contactanto con el servicio tecnico, logramos desbloquear el producto.
I got this phone because I'm disabled with very limited dexterity.
I find just about all phones to be unusable: flip phones and slide phones I can't open; Blackberry style the keys are impossibly small; even most candy bar phones require too much force to work the keypad.
I tried the iPhone but found it too big to hold and use easily with one hand, although like the iPad, it has a very responsive touch screen.
So maybe the smaller LG GD510 would be the answer.
All I can say is: what a huge disappointment.
The touch screen is simply unusable.
Either, and unpredictably, a large amount of force is needed, or the slightest wisp sets it off.
Scrolling is impossible: sliding the finger through the list of name in the address book either does nothing or dials the first number the finger comes near.
The scroll bars were equally useless.
And it wasn't just me: all the able bodied people I gave the phone to had, if not the same difficulty, then at least some difficulty.
If the touch screen hadn't completely defeated me, there are enough other annoyances: the keys lock almost instantly requiring yet more key strokes; using the key pad to search the contact list it seems quite random whether a letter or number appears; a 2.
5mm ear piece jack would be easier to use than mini USB; switching between portrait and landscape modes doesn't always work right; and finally, although a 3\" screen seemed nice, it really needs a 10 year old's fingers to use it.
In fact, once I find a phone I can use, I'll give this to my 10 year old.
The HTC TMobile G1 phone is very very slow, the battery life is like 1hour and the keys are very hard.
first time I bought a second hand cell phone and I am very very disapointed.
buen equipo, excelente funcionamiento era lo que esperaba, lo recomiendo 100 % es de buena calidad y muy buen acabado.
Verizon wireless did not want me to use an unlock phone because they said it has to be from their company.
To me a phone is a phone and it should not matter from where it came from or which provider.
I like it because I don't have to put the phone to my mouth,just hold it to my ear and talk.
I bought these phones to give as a gift for my parents in Brazil.
They were supposed to be unlocked, so they could use it outside the US.
Once they've tried to use it, they realized it was not unlocked and they now have 2 useless phones, They can not ship it back to the US so I can not return it !
This is the first time that I've got a wrong information in Amazon.
It was very disappointing !.
MY KIDS GOT THIS FOR ME FOR CHRISTMAS, AFTER SEEING HOW OLD MY OTHER PHONE WS.
\"EVERYTHING THAT i WANTED AND MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!\".
its unlocked so its like jailbreak so its not going to let you do that much.
The item is good.
but the Interface is not as friendly as in the iPhone.
I will sell this to buy an iPhone.
It is true, have a great camera but the data transfer is easier and faster with the iPhone.
Also to get it sync (specially with mac) it is quite a nightmare.
I go back to my iPhone.
works well.
I bought it for parts and I live in south america and well it works well with the local cell phone company, just needed to change the sim.
This a great beginner phone and more.
I got it to develop some java applications for and ended up loving it.
I use my T-mobile SIM in the phone so get all of my services including internet, email, messaging, and java app's.
If you go to [
]
you will find a lot of games and applications for this phone.
The only thing missing in my opinion is an FM radio, most Nokia's have them so not sure why this one doesn't.
Yes, I love to listen to radio especially when I am working or just commuting on the bus to work.
This phone is great and is a fantastic value.
Everybody knows the storm is a piece of.
t but even knowing that, people want to have it.
RIM is about to launch the Crapberry Storm 2, and you know what?
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT, the second part of an useless and problematic phone?
but even better?
more slowly and painfully?
jajajajajajaja I just can't wait to see people wasting their money on that (if you can call it) \"cutting edge phone\", I am thinking about buying some corn pop and sodas, just to check the reviews for the CRAPBERRY STROM \"2\" Too slow, too glitchy, too bad jajajajajajajajajaja.
And after they'll pray (like now)for an IPHONE (the Storm's father).
You people should think about buying good phones, like Nokia's or HTC's, but CRAPBERRIES?
IPHONE?
even MOTOROLA is the same thing than RIM products, come on think about it.
Have you seen the NOKIA N900?
the HTC DIAMOND 2?
NOKIA has an application called OVI, it is like blackberry messenger but better.
IT'S FREE.
do you think blackberry service is for free?
you should check your accounts, at least in my country, blackberry service, as itself, is not free.
Oh, I almost forgot, I don't have a Crapberry and I wish I never will jajajajajaja but I have to admit that I've been having a lot of fun reading your reviews.
Actually I have an HTC Touch vogue 6900, and I CAN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT IT, I found the software upgrades, games, applications, FOR FREE.
It works like a baby, as a matter of fact IT IS MY BABY.
I am looking to change it for an HTC DIAMOND \"2\", not because of the phone, I just want to have something more advanced, GPS, and all that stuff that I'll never use but I just want to have it (***crazy face*** O_o, MY PRECIOUSSSSSS jijijijijiji).
So, my advice?
if you want it, BUY NOKIA or HTC, but forget it about Crapberry or Iphone.
Do you really want to pay for IPHONE'S applications?
jajajajajajajajajajaja HTC's applications!!!!
you can find it for free, as NOKIA'S too.
upgrades?
FREE too.
Nokia is like Toyota, have you ever seen a Toyota with the hood lifted up in the freeway?
I haven't, as I have never seen a NOKIA driving someone crazy.
For the HTC, well that's another history, I had a HTC 6800 before my glorious HTC 6900, and was a pain in the a
but I just changed it and everything has been good since then.
Well DON'T BUY CRAPBERRIES JUST FOR FASHION, CRAPBERRY idiot people have msn messenger too,  so don't cry, you can chat with them anyway.
bye.
I received an email announcing the cell was shipped.
I wait more than 2 weeks and it never arrived, but my credit card was charged.
I had to write 2 emails to make them check the correct status of the order and days ago I received an email that I was going to receive the corresponding refund, with not clarification of the issue.
Great business!!!.
gets good signal and good sound ez to use , i loved this phone.
and now they are making me type more stuff so they will post it and i HATE this !.
This phone didn't even work properly.
It constantly gave me problems.
I will never order from her again.
The phone was constantly freezing, turning off, dropping calls.
It was a waste of my money.
LG CT810 is an economical alternative among smart phones.
Its sleek design and Windows mobile phone makes this a useful tool.
Their tools include the GPS that works very well with google maps, FM receiver and camera.
A disadvantage is speed, the touch screen is slow at times.
Oh sure, I loved this phone when I first got it.
It works great right out of the box.
You would expect that.
But for something that's supposed to compete with things like the iPhone or other smart phones, this thing sucks.
It works great until you actually want to start doing things with it.
Try to add a few apps to it, that'll slow it down considerably.
Try to multitask, once again, slowed down.
Ohhh.
And I won't even start to mention how many times apps crash!
Yeah, T-Mobile has great customer service, but once I sent this piece in I got billed $100 for water damage.
(Even though the white dot inside the phone was still white!)
If I were to sum this review up, I would say: Sure if you want a \"smart phone\" that you can use for everything a normal phone can do, buy thing thing.
But if you want something that's actually \"smart,\" don't even bother.
This phone is nothing but a headache.
I'm counting the days my contract is up and I can leave T-Mobile's horrible network (They call it 4G when it doesn't even run at 3G speeds!)
and get a better provider and phone!.
I would recomend this phone to any one, great service shipping wise and over all amazing phone and came with everything it said it would.
i would like to know more about the especification of this mobile.
and what you will put in the package.
i mean.
the power adapter earphones and all that.
i hope you understand my cuestion.
Yes, you heard it right, Sony X10 will be shipped with Android 1.
6.
And you will be stuck with it for a very long and miserable time.
Every major android phones are upgrading (or already did) to Android 2.
2 (aka Froyo) this summer.
And guess what, Sony announced they hope they can upgrade X10 to Android 2.
1 (not even 2.
2 !!!)
by the end of 2010.
By that time, Android probably already at 2.
5 or even higher 3.
0.
This should tell you how backward and outdated Sony now is.
buenas tardes me podria enviar fotos del producto iphone 3g gracias mi email elgran12.
1@hotmail.
com gracias me parece un buen producto y deseo comprarlo gracias.
Excelente!
los recomiendo 100%, el env\u00edo fue r\u00e1pido, el articulo llego tal cual fue descrito en las caracter\u00edsticas del producto.
Compra realizada desde Venezuela!!.
Dropped my 30 day old Droid Eris 3ft out of my pocket and the screen SHATTERED.
No rocks, no corners, nothing sharp.
just a short fall that hit the corner of the frame.
Apparently this constitutes abuse the local and corporate Verizon offices so I have to fork out $250 for a new phone.
Don't tell me I should have bought insurance.
The phone may have not been \"designed\" to be dropped but it's a reasonable expectation that it should be able to withstand a short fall.
DON'T BUY IT or insure it to the MAX!!!.
I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AS A GIFT FOR MY MOTHER.
I ORDERED IT IN BLACK AND RECEIVED A BLUE PHONE.
THIS IS MY ONLY COMPLAINT AS MY MOTHER LOVES A NOKIA FLIP.
This is the unlocked version of the Verizon Droid.
The Android App Market sees this phone like it sees other phones that have been hacked.
Even if you never tamper with your device and buy it from a respectable retail outlet like amazon.
com, you still won't be able to access more than half of the android app market because Google considers (for a reason not yet known) this unlocked phone to be hacked.
Be warned.
This phone advertises itself a functional smartphone with all the capabilities you'd expect from a $400 phone.
email, wireless, navigation, etc.
I have been extremely (repeat: extremely) disappointed with both the basic and sophisticated features of this product.
The difficulty ranges from the clunky and counter-intuitive Nokia platform that is in all of their smartphone devices to the basic ability to use a phone.
Often when my phone rings, the touch screen doesn't illuminate and thus the touch screen is inoperable and I'm unable to answer the call.
It is unreliable at basic downloads and then without notice will be busy for extended periods of time downloading old messages and updating itself, missing incoming phone calls and text messages.
Especially given the cost of this phone, it is an egregiously terribly product.
Do NOT buy it unless you'd like to replace it with a new Blackberry in 3 months like I had to do.
Thinking about buying a Pebl?
Don't hesitate.
If you are looking for a good carry phone that is solid , has good voice quality , takes pictures fairly well , and will hold a couple of mp3 tunes this could be the one for you.
This is not a champion multi-media phone but it will handle your light work.
It is solidly constructed and I actually liked the rubber finish.
It's an older model so the U
I
is a bit dated don't let that scare you.
If you just need a basic phone that has a few tricks up it's sleeve you may just get a Pebl for your thoughts.
This phone has absolutely no signal.
We got it for my boyfriend's daughter for emergencies but if she can't get a signal what good is it?.
Beware!
beware!!
beware!!!
i bought this phone the battery didnt work and no sim card.
so be well aware you may have to buy a new battery and you will have to buy a sim card.
lucyly i had a straight talk version of the phone so i could use that battery.
but if im paying for something it should work with all parts included!
then after i make my buy a straight talk version pops up for sale.
avoid the hassle buy a straight talk version.
but beware of the used one ppl swap the original sim and send it back.
and if you do your research you will see why.
but at&t; need to step its game up at this rate verizon has got nothing much to worry about.
I bought this phone for my 12 year old son and i use it some time.
IT IS JUNK.
first of all if you are on a daily plan without a data plan your minutes go quick.
when you go on google and type in a search thats a dollar there.
and the internet button is very easy to press so when you press thats like $0.
19
also if you drop it, the battery comes out and the battery cover comes off.
then you have to go through the long reboot.
also when you first get the phone you have to have soo.
much info and you can only call from a homeline.
you cant put money on it until you call the or go on the internet for them to activate.
if you get a live wallpaper, it will eat up all your battery power so dont get fooled to buy one.
the camera is good in light but at night it is like a 1990 camera.
horrible.
Anyway this phone is a good choice for starters but there are way better and way worst.
phone died in 5 days.
4 and counting attempts by nokia to repair  SAME ISSUEif you find anything wrong.
RETURN for REFUND immed if possible.
Purhcased at NYC flagship store.
I had the phone working for 1st 5 days.
When the battery started to discharge, i tried charging.
It didnt charge at all.
Store gave me new battery saying battery was at fault.
Again same issue.
It wudnt even turn on with the charger connected - so clearly its not just battery problem.
By the time this battery discharged , the 14 day return period was over - pretty sure they knew it.
Then started the saga of sending to nokia service center - PALCO.
Already sent 4 times.
each time had to ship back same evening or next day.
Same problem for \"repaired\" \"replaced\" and \"repaired again\" phone.
First they claim its \"repaired\", then 2nd time they claim \"cannot be repaired.
so replaced\".
why did they send it then?but the so called replaced also had same issue - how can this be co-incidence?again sent.
they claim repaired.
but same issue.
When i call.
they dont agree to send me a courtesy phone since its clearly their mistake and 4 attempts are enough to figure out im being cheated.
They wont give me refund or replacement.
They wont even agree to send me a email saying they take responsibility to resolve the issue.
5 is not my lucky number.
i have no hope it will get resolved.
looks like they will continue playing ping-pong till end of 12 months.
WORST set of people.
Bottom line: NEVER BUY UNLOCKED PHONES- even if its nokia flagship storeNEVER BUY NOKIARETURN WHEN YOU CAN.
The headset of my nokia n97mini is disapointing its been two weeks now since i have started using the phone butthe output quality is very very poor.
and I dont know why so please ladies and genttlemen if anyone knows a solutionto my problem please help me out bcos am worried about it.
however,my second problem is the wireless conections is wifi is hard to conect!.
This little phone actually does quite a bit for how inexpensive it is.
I was surprised at how long the battery lasts, too.
Verizon's network has always seemed solid, and I never had any dropped calls with this phone, either.
Would recommend!.
The LG NEON Go-Phone from At7T is an awful cellphone, the speaker quality is lousy which makes it difficult to hear while using the phone.
I used AT&T; and was very unhappy with their poor customer service.
I switched back to T-Mobile and was glad I did.
The lg rumor 2 appears to be a good phone i've held it in stores and it feels very solid.
The qwerty keypad is okay.
kajeets coverage is through sprint.
the nagatives is its way too expensive and no touch screen.
All in all kajeet needs more qwerty keypad phones, and this is the best qwerty phone that kajeet has.
Also kajeet is only 15.
00 for unlimited texting.
Please note that the 1-star review is for this particular listing (advertising that it includes \"1 year of GPS\"), NOT for the phone itself, nor for kajeet phone service, which we haven't yet had the chance to try.
I bought this phone on Amazon instead of directly from kajeet despite a higher price tag because of the supposed \"1 year of GPS\" included with the phone.
Upon receiving the phone, I tried to activate it online and it did not appear to include GPS; I was merely offered the option to pay the usual charge for their monthly GPS service, but that was it.
I then called to try to activate over the phone and was told that there was no such \"Safety Package\" and that kajeet doesn't even OFFER \"a year of GPS\"; rather, that GPS is (as described on the website) included in certain monthly plans or you can pay as you go (which is what their website indicates is ordinarily the case).
Even after checking with a supervisor, the rep didn't seem interested in sorting out why this was being sold on Amazon and just suggested that I contact the seller.
Luckily, the customer service rep at Amazon was responsive and helpful.
She is following up on this for me & said she would have an answer for me in 3 to 5 days.
When I explained that I really needed to get this sorted out before that time because I'd promised my child a phone before the start of school, and that I'd really prefer to just go ahead & purchase a phone elsewhere, she immediately sent me a return authorization so that I could ship the phone back at no cost to myself.
She also said that to make up for the confusion, I'd be given a $25 promotional credit in case I chose to buy another phone through Amazon, or even to re-purchase this same one after the confusion is sorted out.
UPDATE - two days later:  I ordered a replacement phone directly from kajeet instead.
This morning, I got a call from a kajeet rep who explained that the GPS offer is a very old offer and that she doesn't know why anyone would be trying to sell it now, but that she's trying to straighten this out with Amazon and with Sanyo.
(After the initially helpful response from Amazon on Tuesday, I'm surprised that Amazon still has the phone listed this way two days later, but here it is
)
She apologized for the confusion & was calling to let me know that (per my request in an email I sent to kajeet Tues
complaining about the situation) they have upgraded the shipping on my replacement phone at no charge, and it should arrive today instead of in 3-5 business days.
This rep was much more helpful than the one I first spoke to and is making me feel a lot better about my decision to give kajeet a 2nd chance at our business.
Fingers crossed!
(TIP: Even if you order directly through kajeet, be sure to search the web for discount codes above & beyond what are offered on their site.
I was able to get this same phone in another color (my child's first choice) for 15% off the listed price (which is lower than the price now listed on amazon, no doubt partly because kajeet isn't claiming to bundle the phone with 12 mo.
of GPS).
I purchased this less than 4 months ago, but more than 90 days ago.
I just began to have a problem that  others have reported online(a white screen, so you can't see anything, but the phone works).
Motorola only gives it a 90 day warranty and wants to charge me $110 to fix it.
Others have had similar problems as well.
I paid $185 for the phone and expect it to work more than 90 days, and not to be charged as much to repair as it would cost to buy new now.
Buyer beware when buying Motorola, poor quality, almost non existent warranty, and poor customer support.
I will never buy another Motorola product and will recommend against it for others.
The phone arrived on time and the condition of the phone was great.
It was neatly and carefully packed as well.
Loving my new phone it's simple and easy to use on daily bases, and it's pink!
Great and quick service.
i received a T-Mobile phone, and it is not fully unlocked.
I regret my purchase.
Like the tradition of the blackberrys products, the 8120 is a good option in size, ellegance and results.
In the world most people dont konw.
there are  more better androidphones in japan.
Fujitu ,Toshiba,kyocera  make smartphones in Japan, not made in Chaina.
Of course battery life is long.
Did not like it because it didn't have all the features I was looking for.
Este producto llego en mal estado, se apagaba solo y ahora no enciendeHe escrito varios correos y nadie me da respuesta a mi reclamo, estoy totalmente insatisfecha con esta compraatentamentemilagros rosalvenezuelamilagroscapote@yahoo.
com0414-903-1407.
I got this phone so I can continue hooked to my job, it's fast and powerful.
I primarily use it for email and instant messaging, fits great in your pocket and syncs in a few seconds even when connected to slow networks.
I heard people complaining about the 2MP camera, but if you need to take sharp pictures then get a Canon!
:)I still gotta keep playing with it to take advantage of all its features but so far it's a five stars phone to me!.
This company said they would deliver the product by a specific date yet it didn't come and they never told me why.
I wrote them and they finally got back to me like a week later and said it was out of stock.
Wouldn't recommend this company!.
This phone was fine at first.
However, after only a few months it started deteriorating.
My user habits are very basic, I talk and text, that's it.
I don't use any other features.
Now, after using this phone only 9-10 months, when I make calls all of the people on the other end tell me they can barely hear me, some not well enough to even continue to try to talk.
It has to be this phone because I'm told the same thing by everyone I call, regardless of their location.
(i would give it negative 10 stars, but one star is the lowest rating at Amazon)In short, here is my summary after 10 years:1.
The customer service non-existent:  they take your money and run, you are on your own after that.
if you call customer service - brace yourself for at least 30 min waiting time.
2.
The phones are flimsy.
They feel cheap and they look cheap.
3.
I've got huge number of unknown incoming calls (which were burning my airtime).
Sometimes in the middle of the night.
4.
Cost of call per minute is higher than any other carrier.
5.
If you want to roll over your unused minutes you have to keep buying more airtime - which is essentially a rolling contract -  more expensive than VZ or ATT.
6.
Miniscule pool of phone numbers to select from (i could choose from only one!)7.
They can close the shop at any given moment - and you'll pick up the loss.
They don't care about you anyways!8.
Terrible connection.
Phone connects sporadically, sometimes does not connect the call at all.
I had this phone for emergencies for my mom, and I have a contract with Verizon.
When you call Verizon they work with you to solve the problem.
When you call Tracfone - they don't give a \"1234\" about your problem, they don't even ATTEMPT to solve the problem!!
!Before dealing with tracfone ask yourself:  if they treat like \"1234\" a customer who was buying from them for a decade, how will they treat you?PS.
BTW, when i callded tracfone with a problme, they essentially told me that they have company policies, and they don't care about the customers or long term profits (only short term).
I was shocked!
What a myopic vision: in the current economy a company dependent on month-to-month sales would severe 10 year long customer relationship!.
This phone is great for talking in the shower.
No speaker-phone and REALLY bad reception.
I dropped it and it fell apart.
The worst phone and minute plan you can buy.
I lost 63 dollars using this phone.
The minutes will be lost if not used right away.
Do not count on Virgin Mobile customer service to help you.
The LG GD910 is really a cool cell phone, mp3 player, video player, watch, camera, video camera, Wi-Fi device, etc.
It does all the things that is claimed, BUT there are a few problems:  First, the headset is very fragil and will break at the point it goes into the watch and it does not fit snuggly into the watch.
Also the headset is made for someone with short arms.
If you are under 5'9\" or have a 32\" sleeve length, it may be more comfortable to wear.
Second, the cell phone does not work very well with all bluetooth devices.
It has excellent volumn with with Philips, Motorola and Jabra, but low volumn with Emerson and N9 stylus models.
Third, the watch face on the box in the ads is not the watch face that is actually on the watch.
Forth, the Voice Response system was not done by someone who fully understands English.
Fifth, the Contact list should be revived to remove Mobile from being the default selection.
Other then those irritation, the cell phone watch is a lot of fun.
Remember, VERIZON does not like to allow phones that use SIM cards on their network.
Nearly all other service can provide a SIM card and activate your phone instantly.
Consumer Cellular will send you an activated SIM card in the mail for this phone.
Back to the phone.
It is quite a fancy device that should bring a lot of fun and lots of conversation about the cell phone.
I give it a five star because the phone is durable.
The keyguard stops accidental calling.
This phone has a larger key pad and also has a camera.
I dropped it a couple of times, still works find.
A good bargain for the money.
aura717.
too simple, too oldsamsung & jitterbug should update this phone with a newer and more up to date model.
Sorry to leave feed back so late.
Phone works fine.
Did have a small problem with screen not turning back on when the screen is off and you slide phone open to start.
If you use the power button then there is no longer this problem.
But the phone its self is in great condition.
I bought this phone about 10 months ago because I was a fan of the previous generation Razr.
This phone has been a big dissapointment.
The battery life is poor.
The bluetooth has a very short range.
I have problems with the phone cutting out and I have to shut it down and restart the phone to get it to work connect again.
I am currently looking at new phones and this one has been bad enough that I am not looking at Motorola.
I was a bit skeptical about buying a phone without seeing it in person.
I was so happy when this arrived!
It's beautiful.
I'm also happy it doesn't have AT&T; written on the bottom.
I did manage to break the battery door, so I'd advise anyone to be careful.
Verizon's customer service is notoriously bad, something driven home after a recent encounter.
We had 7 charges from Verizon Wireless on our bank statement that were debited by Verizon Wireless Prepaid Account in one day without being credited to the cell phone account.
We called Verizon's customer service and both the rep and supervisor refused to look into the issue, so we had to file disputes with our bank.
So far, the attempt to add $20 to the cell phone account has cost us more than 4 hours and more than $150 in contested fees.
On the flip side.
no problems with our LG phones.
Beautiful cell!
I wait for it just 3 days!
It was fantastic!
The cell appeared very well treated.
I recommend to you to get it.
this product is horrible.
my friend barely dropped it from the bed to floor and the screen broke!
the keys also stopped working and it turns off fast.
do not purchase!.
I have had my HD2 less than a week.
I have just emailed HTC to tell them that I will be returning it if I do not get answers.
It is that simple.
The important question is Windows Mobile 7 upgradable?It leaves me with a bad feeling.
What HTC is doing is completely UNETHICAL !
!It's like New HD2 vs Old HD2 !WTF and for THE SAME PRICE!I TOLD YOU WE WERE BETA TESTERS !!.
I liked it  so much, so I ordered a second one.
For anybody that want a handy cell phone without.
Not a single complaint, reception is super and much better than other phones I had before.
O
Garcia.
It was a good looking phone but when you talked on it it sounded real quiet on both ends my husband didn't like that because that was why I had bought him this one because he was tired of that on his other phone.
70 dollars, cheep, right?
believe me it looks veeeryyy cheep too!
it is like a plastic toy, maybe good for 14 year old girls!
i ordered black from JandR, i got blue.
bad service, cheep phone made in China!!!!!
nokia and made in China!!!
what a shame!
Bad reception too!
Save money!
buy smth else!!!
unless u r a 14 year old girl.
When i received this item it was defective.
I issues with it powering off randomly and then at times unable to retrieve the screen.
This would have been my 3rd G-1.
My first I loved i never had problems with it bought it directly from T-moblie over here in the US.
My 2nd one was bought from Hong Kong over Ebay and it worked great for about 7 months then it began to have the same problems as this G-1 with the random power downs and the inability to retreive the screen after it's shutdown and at times unable to power back on.
They also to have seem to suck the battery life right out of it something i never experienced with my very first G-1 so not sure what the problem is maybe it has to do with Foreign product I don't know.
Hmmm contrary to the stellar reviews here, mine maybe different and I hate to admit that the Nexus one isnt as good as I thought it was, not even near to that.
I have a nokia e71, excellent phone PERIOD, had to give it to my girlfriend and I needed a new phone.
I had to decide between the iphone and the nexus one, I hate apple cuz I have a 30gb classic video ipod and the experience I had with it was very bad.
I just hate the way apple complicates things for users with the itunes and all.
Iphone out of picture.
Based on a weeks research ive decided to get the nexus one.
Got it the next day  thanks to the overnight shipping from google.
Coming to the nexus one, beautiful,awesome screen, easy UI, everything was just so great BUT BUT had to return the phone after 2 days.
I cudnt even eat the whole day I sent the phone back, everything was so nice except for the damn wifi issues.
It drove me mad and I went berserk searching on the net for fixes, downloaded the wifi fixer, tried a million things from the forums but nothing worked.
The wifi connects only to open networks, it did connect to my wpa secured home network but the connection drops every 3-5 min and i had to reconnect that again.
My friend's WEP secured network doesnt even connect.
As a last resort I called google hoping they will be able to fix it, the representative asked me to return the phone cuz maybe I got a defective piece.
The customer service was gr8, they offered the full amount I paid back, didnt charge me the restocking fee(im glad).
Even now I cant believe I had to send it back, such a gr8 phone except for the wifi issues.
I hope its a defect only in my phone.
Please do google NEXUS ONE WIFI issues before you buy the phone, just dont want you guys to be disappointed like me.
If you dont care about the wifi, dont even think of any other phone, you wont find any, iphone is just a toy when compared to this.
I even ordered a casemate for the nexus one, lost 30 bucks for that now that I dont have the nexus one anymore, anyway the case was ugly so no regrets, If you are looking for a nexus case go for the sedio innocase ii.
So I get this link from Amazon to review the iPhone.
I guess millions in sales, the app store and that it holds its vaule isnt enough for people to make a decision whether to purchase one or not.
Perhaps there should be an indicator on the top items being sold by Amazon to dentote if a review is required or not.
I guess its the same as asking me to review a 5 lb bag of sugar.
Some people may be on the fence on whether they want to keep their kool-aid sweetened or not.
But, nonetheless, I'm a team player and which to contribute to the electronic collective of those with opinions on items that they purchased.
Thusly, after carefull scientific analysis and many discussion panels with my colleges: Here is my final official and ready to publish review of the iPhone 3G with the white backing and 16gb of mememory:Purpose:To provided a totally biased review of a used iPhone 3g with 16GB of storage.
Abstract:I bought it, used it as both a phone, entertainment device and sliding projectile.
Conclusions:Its pretty cool.
Works Cited:None.
it is a very good phone.
the only thing was that it did not came with the usb cable.
but works great!!!.
My phone arrived without a charger!
well The packing was pretty much just bubble wrapped and the phone could have been damaged during shipping.
The phone was in good condition.
This is the first time I buy something on Amazon and it doesnt come new.
I dont know when this began but it looks like amazon is letting other people sell their stuff.
people who dont own stores.
Ive already bought like 4 cel phones and all of them came with their original boxes and all the accessories.
But this cel just came in an empty box (the cel with just a bubble bag) with a non original charger which is now giving me problems cause it disconnects when it wants to.
I had to pay more than 60$ to get the other accessories (instalacion cd, car charger, headphones, etc.
)The cel phone is ok, but is partially locked.
you have to hack it to make it fully unlocked.
Shipping did make it on time.
I wish amazon wouldnt let people sell their leftovers in this site, thats why ebay exists, and thats why i never buy there.
Thank you.
I had to send the first Phone back because it did not work.
It was kind of a pain in the neck to do.
It could not go back to the original shipper and I had to send in an e-mail to get a confirmation number before I could ship the broken phone for repair / replacement.
The new phone came within a few days and works as well as advertised.
Unfourtunately the phone did not come with the $50- Motorola Phone Tools CD to use all of the functions of the phone.
The phone reception is very clear, It is easy to use, and works well with my Blue Tooth devices.
I should have known this wouldn't work when I opened the package and the first thing I found was a note from the seller requesting that I not give them a negative review should the phone not work!
Right away, I realized that the keyboard was non-functional.
After 2 days, the port where the charger goes into the phone broke and the phone has been dead since then.
The contact information for the seller doesn't work.
Buyer beware!.
It's a good cell.
I sold to one of my friends, he was in love with this phone.
If you like buy it!!!.
I want this phone, but I need RCM72UW model, which is working with bands 850/1900/2100 and 3G version would be the AT & T, Rogers, Telus.
please tell me if is this model?
I need this information to make the purchase!
I would appreciate it to be honest in the answers!
thank you!.
the day i recieved the phone, i let the phone charge.
once i put the phone on a blue screen showed up and said there was an error and unable to be resolved.
i brought it to sprint.
the tech tried to reset it and other stuff.
after a 15 min wait  he told me that they had sent me a damaged phone.
now i have to send this phone back and do this and that then wait to recieve a nother one.
im hoping this one works.
now i have to pay for shipping and handling  out of pocket on a phone thats crap.
I received this phone awhile back at first it was awesome.
after having it for awhile this phone started showing its true colors.
Sure the camera is great on it, I personally found it to have the best signal out of all my other phones.
HOWEVER, this phone freezes all the time, the battery life is crap, and did I mention it freezes all the time!
The texting on this phone is extremely awkward.
I wish it had a different operating system on it, because it is does give me great signal, but signal dont mean nothing when it freezes most the time.
WELL phone i  loveit but is not compatible with mi car stereo ( Pioneer CD-BTB200 ), blackberry 8520 (cheapest) show my favorite cellphone a lesson.
htc people shut works on problems first , then BE \"QUIETLY BRILLIANT\".
I had great expectations for this Android phone.
But to be honest my Android experience has bee less-than-spectacular.
I have found many aspects lacking in email support on Andriod (2.
2).
First, the Active-sync abilities are poor at best.
Most users (me included) report that they have numerous problems with Exchange email sync.
I personally have not been able (despite many attempts) to ever get a clean sync.
Another issue is the lack of HTML support in email.
if you like plain text email then you will like Android.
I have decided to go back to Iphone as the Active sync with Exchange works very well and the HTML features in email are very pleasant and similar to using your laptop to do email.
By the way I have also attempted to try two other Androids after the Desire (Dell Venue and HTC Inspire 4G).
Both are Android 2.
2 phones and both has similar issues with email.
Bottom line.
If you are needing Exchange support from your mobile phone you may want to skip Android.
If you're looking for all the bells and whistles in a phone, this isn't for you.
it's a standard flip phone.
I have been through 3 of them, only because one fell in the lake(IT'S NOT WATERPROOF!
), and the other was smashed(IT'S FAIRLY STURDY FOR A FLIP PHONE BUT NOT INVINCIBLE!).
My current one (3rd), I have had for 5 month, never had any problems, no black screens or freezing of program, unlike some reviewers claim above me.
I bought all of mine brand new, so if you buy a \"refurbished\" unit, stuff like that tends to happen.
I do NOT advise buying used cell phones.
For $56 shipped, brand new, you can't beat this phone, period.
para mi opinion el precio esta fabuloso 60.
00 con internet, foto en fin todo no esta mal pero todo lo bonito tiene su precio y lo que no me tiene contenta con este telefono es que cada ves que quiero ir a el internet empiesa aprocesar y creanme me muero de coraje porque tengo que esperar por lo menos 2 minuto no es siempre pero la mayor parte del tiempo y cuando quiero mandar foto olvidensen se frisa y me toca quitarle la batteria si alguien sabe de algun telefono bueno de boost que no tenga este problema porfavor dejenmen saber gracias.
I phone was used as stated but it is a junk phone the sound is worthless miss 95% of calls.
There seems to be apart of the windows program that does not work.
Feel ripped off.
this phone sucks big time , people dont even waist your time to look at it because the phone does not even worth 15 dollars the quality of this phone is really really bad.
Excelente modelo practico, funcional, buena resolucion, viene completo con cable audifonos y 2 GB de memoria.
Las fotos se deben tomar con la mano estable, facilmente salen borrosas.
Por todo lo demas es un gran telefono.
Excellent services!
The phone came with complete accessories in a sealed box before the estimated delivery time.
Everything works perfectly.
Would definitely buy from Amazon again!.
Can anyone tell me if this phone is a US original version phone or those fake ones from China?
Because it stated make in China on the outside of the box.
Thanks!.
Okay, The Phone Arrived On Time, It Was A Good Looking Phone.
Had The Phone, Headphones, Charger, And Manual.
i Turn It On And Just Checking It Out, Putting My Wifi Pass In.
So then After A Couple Of Hours I Wanna See How It \"Sounds\", So I Go On The YouTube App, And Type In A Song Name, And Click It, No Sound?
Turn The Voulume Up, No Sound?
I Put Headphones In And Then I Care Here It.
The Phone Wont Play Sound Without Headphones, SO I Though It Was Just Made Like That?
But After Pushing Down On The Back (Without Headphones In, And Music Playing) I Heard The Music Play.
I Took The Back Off To Look At The Speaker, I Just Pushed Down Really Hard On It, And It Started To Play Without Me Holding Down The Back, It Does Stop SOmetimes But Just A Kind Of Push with The Finger To The Back Makes It Work Again!But The Phone Is Great, Nice Sensitivity, Fast, All Togather The Phone Is Great, Even With That Small Flaw.
I am very disapointed!I ordered a Samsum Tocco lite and then I recieved a Samsung Star GT-S5230 instead!.
I am pleased to say I am satisfied with the cell phone.
The seller was great in helping with my satisfaction.
I would recommend a purchase from sunnyfall because they are really for the customer and have a great cell phone.

EL TELEFONO ES MUY LINDO PERO ES MAS MALO, POR QUE  NO TIENE PARA LENGUAJE ESPA\u00d1OL, Y ES MISION IMPOSIBLE CONECTARSE AL WI-FI.
DE VERDAD ESTOY BIEN DECEPCIONADA.
Is a great phone portable and has WiFi, conftable forma people that wants a small pone with al os evrything that you need.
I have a Samsung S3600i.
This is a backup.
It is new and works fine.
The volume is excellent.
It is the best flip phone I have had.

FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT NOT ENGAGE IN SMART PHONE PLANET, THOSE THAT JUST WANT SPEAK AND EAR IN SIMPLE PHONE CALL, THIS IS THE EXACT PHONE.
ADITIONALLY HAVE MP3 PLAYER STEREO, MAPS, GAMES, DECENT CAMERA AND MEMORY ENOUGHT FOR BASIC APPS.
Very sad indeed, if you could see my eyes, you would see the sadness.
My wonderful girlfriend Loves the H
Kitty stuff, soooo.
We bought this and it sucked.
I bought samsung s5620 monto unlocked from you ,, and you sent locked phone by orange ,, are kidding with mee !!!!!!!!
i live in us i cant use loked orange phone.
late and locked !!!!!!!
i cant stand this.
THIS PHONE DOES NOT PERFORM WELL.
FEATURES SEEM TO BE BACKWARDS IE.
SPEAKER ON OR OFF.
THEY ARE THE OPPOSITE!
ON AND ON IT GOES.
BE SURE TO DO YOUR REVIEWS RESEARCH.
i bought this phone as a christmas gift for one of my sons.
after asking how he rates his phone, he gives it a bajillion points so, again, like his older brothers review of the torch i bought for him, i can only assume as well this is a fabulous choice for a teenager.
pros-fast responive interface-compact-decent screen res-comes with wi-fi router software-acceleromtercons-no US 3g (pretty standard with unlocked GSM phones, but makes the wi-fi router slightly less useful)-Win Mobile 6.
5 won't be supported much longer-somewhat expensiveAs you might be able to tell, this phone is basically an unlocked Windows Mobile version of the AT&T; HTC Aria (Android).
I'd say, you're probably better off getting the Aria subsidized than getting this at ~$400.
I do like this phone in general, but since it's Win Mobile and and doesn't have 3G, I wouldn't want to pay a premium to get a phone that's \"previous generation\" and has its better days behind it.
Either wait for this price to drop a little or get the Aria subsidized.
This is just one of the models that use the Android market and I would have never purchased any phone that used that application market if I knew what I was getting into.
I have this phone for 2 weeks now and I am one of the hundreds or thousands of users that couldn't download a single free application for the phone.
\"Starting download\" is the hated message that is seen forever on the Android market application.
When we pay this sort of price for a damn phone we are not expecting to not even being able to download a simple free app, and if you search online for words such as \"htc stuck on starting download\" you will see how massive this problem is and for how long this has been around (single february at least) without a solution and with total disregard to the customers.
I'm still waiting for the damn conference HTC will make similar to apples phone issue.
P
S
The phone itself is quite good, but when the software works so poorly on something as critical as an application market I can only consider it a bad product.
Nice Mobile FOR Samsung its nice also design but is not for woman is only for man, also is big mobile for used.
I returned this phone because it did not recieve a signal.
I was trying to replace the old Z9 that the button had worn out  on.
The old one was the opposite.
It recieve a signal where no other phone could.
I am not sure what was wrong with this one.
After reading all the reviews on this site I have concluded that this is another product that AARP allowed to advertise in their magazine but has issues.
It has been years now since I bought something advertised in the magazine but the time that I did I had to return the product.
The magazine is like all others, they just need the revenue.
Which reminds me that after writing to AARP to complain the answer I got was they can't screen all their advertisers.
You would think that an organization dedicated to seniors would be looking out for us.
NOT!I just use the membership to get discounts when I travel and nothing else.
Sorry some of that money pays for lobbyists.
BUYER BE WARE.
What sounds too good to be true probably is.
Looked great when I got it.
Paint has since worn off in areas.
Battery life so-so.
Speakerphone hard to hear.
Small screen has developed what can best be described as a pink \"cataract.
\" But glad to have a nice phone that works, without having to renew any sort of contract.
Bought this yesterday, the day it came out.
Cannot install apps from the web because according to the \"level 4\" Motorola Support guy I talked to \"due to carrier restrictions.
\" Do not buy this phone, as this severely limits what you can do with your phone.
I tried to install Google's own scripting app and I can't due to this restriction.
Also bad:Comes with several apps from AT&T; that you cannot uninstall including the useless AT&T; Navigator which requires an expensive monthly subscription, AT&T; Music and other junk apps from AT&T; taking up the limited space you have to install apps.
Also uses Yahoo!
search, something you can't change.
They removed Google search from Google's own mobile operating system.
Comes with the old Android 1.
5 and says \"upgradable to 2.
1\" but guess what: you have to wait for Motorola to upgrade you whenever they decide they'll upgrade all these phones.
Until then you're stuck with this old version of Android.
The brightness setting only changes the brightness for the screen and not the backlit buttons which are very bright - so if you are trying to limit brightness in a dark room, you can't, and it sucks up your battery.
The screen is pretty small and most of the time this isn't so bad, but some apps you can hardly read the fonts because they are so small.
Otherwise the keyboard is very nice.
I like the hardware, the little touchpad on the back and how it flips but the software restrictions imposed by AT&T;  have ruined this phone and am returning it.
Don't buy it.
Get a Verizon Droid or a Nexus 1.
Much better phones.
I rate as a one becuz nothing ur work it had no back piece it won't charge it some bulls***.
PLEASE DON'T GET THIS PHONE FOR A TEENAGER.
MY OPINION IT IS DESIGNED FOR AN OLDER PERSON 50 AND ABOVE WHO ONLY WANTS TO TALK AND NOT INTERESTED IN DOWNLOADS OR TEXT MESSAGES.
MAYBE SOME ELEMENTARY KIDS WHO WILL FEEL GOOD TO ONLY HAVE A PHONE AND TO TALK TO THEIR SCHOOL FRIENDS.
THIS IS JUST NOT FOR ME, SORRY I HAD TO RETURN THIS  ITEM I WAS NOT SATISFIED FOR THIS USE IT WOULD GIVE.
I LIKE MY RING TONES AND MUSIC DOWNLOADS.
This phone was not in good working condition.
The camera did not work.
The phone sounded terrible and it would not update my contacts.
I sent the phone back and I am hoping that I am not charged a restocking fee.
Ia m keeping my old lg.
I've gotten many compliments on this phone.
People have told me they can tell it's not American and get excited when I show them the dual camera feature.
I'm glad I bought it with warranty and unlocked (glad I read about it) or else I'd have serious problems.
I am using T-Mobile service with this phone and since it's only a prepaid account and with minimal services, I don't get to use every feature (such as video call) that I could get if I had a contract.
I have trouble sending picture messages, but I have yet to find out if it's because of my service or if I had to change the settings in order to get them.
Nevertheless, it's a great phone.
It's colorful, simple, and nice to have.
I would like to buy lg unlock lollipop pink phonePlease available quicklyI want it so muchI was saving my money to buy itonce I have enough money to buy itIt was out of stockit's so sadplease have this product backthanks.

I would like to know if you can use that phone in Venezuela, because it says unlocked but does not work for Sprint or Alltel.
THanks.

Not the network or the carriers, only if this product is the OEM No Logo Version.
Straight from Blackberry can you answer me please.
Thank you.

After May 31, 2011 T-Mobile will be deprecating data service to old sidekicks.
You will not be able to browse the web, youtube etc.
You can make calls, receive text- but that's it.
no I didn't do it.
I don't work for them.
But i have 2 sidekicks and just got this notice.
No more data service for older sidekicks anywhere everywhere no you're not special.
sorry.
So I bought this phone, I mean the corbyPro but they sent me Candy 3G, i dont know those are same model or not, they look a like.
And also the language is different, I guess it is Thai, And there is no way you can change the setting.
Please dont buy this phone if you are non thai language spoker, It sucks.
Hola, soy de Venezuela y debo decir que comprar el telefono fue una excelente inversion.
Todo legal y nuevo de paquete, todos sus accesorios funcionan.
Ademas trajo una memoria MicroSD de 2GB.
Hello, I'm from Venezuela and I must say that buying the phone was an excellent investment.
All legal and new package, all accessories work.
You brought a 2GB MicroSD memory.
Hola les comento que el servicio de venta de amazon es excelente el producto lo recibi rapido y en buen estado los invito a usar este medio de compra.
Hi there,i want to know what is in the box?is the phone is new condition?can i video chat with that phone?.
This is an excellent phone in all respects except for one:  It will not allow me to enter my mobile banking site.
There used to be this opinion that in technology smaller is better.
Especially for mobile phones.
Obese lifestyles call for bigger devices, I suppose, but if your style is still of the old school and if you are on the right network, with some caveats this is the phone for you.
Since it is exactly what I want, I am very happy with it.
It's supposed to be a smart phone.
And it IS smart, both in looks and in function.
The package I got came with earphones and a European-plug charger.
I was warned about this, and so invested in a European-to-N
American plug converter, and a USB data cable.
I also invested in a new 4gig memory card, and reused my old bluetooth earpiece.
Packaging may vary, so check very carefully what comes in the package you are getting.
I bought it unlocked and dropped in the memomy card and the SIM from my prepaid old phone on the Rogers network in Canada.
Initial charging was very quick, taking no more than an hour to reach full battery capacity.
First time I turned on the phone a few initial-configuration screens came up; the most complicated setting was to get the time zone info to update automatically from the network.
Once the initial configuration was done, I entered a few easily-googleable settings for custom streaming and data connections, and I had the smallest 3G phone in the city.
Everything worked as advertised.
:)Charging time is quick -- about four hours from empty -- and the battery lasts about a week, seven days, if you turn the phone off at night but leave it on all day.
Dialing on the small buttons is surprisingly easy if you don't have wide fingers.
I thought mine weren't small, but I've had far fewer mishits than on my old Samsung J706.
Answering the phone is particularly easy since I have a bluetooth earpiece.
Voice audio is excellent.
I suppose the choice of network is important, though.
The screen is small, but if your eyes can handle it, it is very bright, except in direct sunlight.
The phone is small enough, however, that your hand shades the screen almost automatically.
The browsing, app, and game user interfaces the Sony-Ericsson java-os provides are a notch above the competition.
(I have always thought Android and iPhone interfaces were too glitzy to be really usable.
)The radio works quite well.
Likewise the music player.
I have read some complaints about sound quality, but for the basic pop I listen to, it's fine.
The camera, both still and vid, is of expected cell-phone quality.
Perfectly passable snaps close up and of the landscape on sunny days, a little dreary in overcast light.
Again, though, for the kind of use I would expect from a mobile phone, it's more than sufficient.
My one complaint is that no Japanese input method is included with the OS.
This was remedied with a free Java app called BeeperInput (I decompiled it, it looks perfectly safe, and in fact the java platform is a fairly secure one if you're paranoid).
For the occasional texting in Japanese this is enough if you are very patient with the kanji selection, and don't mind a rather intricate copy-and-paste mechanism to get the text into the final texter or browser, as well as simplified-chinese style kanji (the java OS does not allow for custom fonts).
For a few people, I suppose this could be an absolute deal-breaker, but even more will surely not care.
Some people have complained about troubles with early OS releases.
To forestall any problems, I immediately installed the accompanying software (downloadable from the Sony Ericsson site; no CD is included) and updated the OS.
The software is extremely intuitive and the update was quick and problem-free.
The first reboot afterward was so slow I began to worry, but eventually the status bar moved and the phone came up.
To my slight annoyance I had to re-enter the initial confuguration and the data/streaming connectivity info.
But I may well have missed a setting to have those restored automatically, I'm not sure.
Anyway, once that was done I have not had any of the dropped-call errors some people with the initial OS seemed to be complaining about.
(Again, I suppose in part that might be a network issue.
)Sony-Ericsson's content management software is superb, I think.
----So, overall:the PROS:  size if you love it small; looks; functionality; sound quality; associated software.
the CONS:  package does not include everything and some one-time or two-time configuration is required.
No Japanese text built-in, and the one available solution to that is a little clunky though free.
I do not consider the cons any more than a minor one-time annoyance, and the pros are so overwhelming that I give five stars without hesitation.
But I realize some people will look for a different feature set.
The looks and design of phone appears fine if I was only able to use it.
This is a T-Mobile phone and I am on the ATT plan and my sim card does not allow me to use or operate this phone.
Thus, it is useless after repeated attempts to unlock it.
Please email me return instructions.
I had contacted the shipper and was told they were contacting Amazon to have these instructions emailed to me since they did not have the permission from you to do that.
PLEASE REPLYterryecole@yahoo.
com.
Ordered this new unlocked phone since I have a work environment that does not allow cameras.
Charged the phone before turning it on until it stopped charging from a full charge.
Inserted an active T-Mobile sim card and the phone displayed \"insert sim card\".
Inserted an active AT&T; sim card and again the phone displayed \"insert sim card\".
Sent the phone back to Amazon and hope to purchase another that hopefully is in good working order.
I ordered a black phone for my son and we recieved a purple one.
I don't want to have to send it back and pay for the shipping and wait on another phone :(.
Slider, users will certainly speak with style.
With the slim and ergonomic shape fits the phone very nicely in the hand and he slips effortlessly into your purse or pocket.
This slider is not only super modern, but also highly functional.
On the 2 \"wide LCD display lets you see the contents of your phone very clearly.
Beautiful photosWith the built-in VGA camera of the C3050 you can pretty unexpected events now always capture.
You can have great pictures and make them together into a panoramic image.
That is music to the earsThe C3050 gives you the decision on your personal jukebox with your favorite bands, albums and songs.
Transfer your favorite songs on a microSD memory card and even set as background while using other applications on your phone.
If you want to listen to the latest hits, set your FM radio, 24 hours a day that music, news and information.
In short, everywhere and always listen to your favorite music.
The phone came right on time and is in just the condition as explained in the details.
I love using my new motorola devour its a great portable tablet plus great service!.
it was more than icould ask for  very good people to do business with.
it was confusing at first but I caught on and every thing was fine.
The item, I received is a piece of junk.
The piece was described as \"like new\" and \"excellent condition\".
In reality, it was roughly used.
One can find a better piece in trash than this one!.
i have a tracfone and wish i never got into it, once i use the time i have bought, i am out!!!reasons:1.
you can only use the phone in the area code you sign up for.
we traveled from SF, calif and once we got to nevada and tried to make calls it would only come up with an error code, which stopped us from making any calls.
so in travle it is useless.
2
the reception is more than iffy in many places; big cities is ok, but elsewhere very problematic.
3
buying added time is a pure hassle.
only once was i able to do it online.
usually after putting in all the time and info the site says to call the 800#.
then the hassle continues.
trying to get a person is difficut.
when you do, understanding them one needs a translator.
