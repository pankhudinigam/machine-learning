Sure Windows Mobile is uber cool and tons of fun to use, let alone the ease, but the MPx200 fails at the one thing that is supposed to do best, being a phone. | neg: | 0.5

You can drop it from a 50 story building and it would probably just have a scratch. | neg: | 0.5
It's amazing the build quality that Motorola put into this phone, but it goes downhill when discussing the phone as a functional device. | neg: | 0.5
As a phone, it falls very short, especially in the area of battery life. | l: | 0.5
When I initially received the phone, I only charged it for 12 hours due to overexcitment, so I blame myself for not getting through the day without having to charge the phone, but after I bought my second battery and charged it the full term, I was surprised when the battery life didn't improve much. | l: | 0.7
Granted this is just using the phone as a phone, with the Infrared \"Beam\" feature turned off and all the other features either off or at the bare minimum, such as the backlight. | l: | 0.8
I honestly believe that I got much better battery life using the phone as a Video iPod than as a phone. | neg: | 0.6
The battery sipped away during use of Windows Media Player, with excellent sound quality I might add. | pos: | 0.6
On a normal phone call, I got an hour tops, before the battery was on its last bar, far short of the rated 4. | neg: | 0.7
25 hours. | l: | 0.7

Good luck trying to use call waiting, sometimes the phone just freezes up. | l: | 0.7

I got so fed up with it that I took out the SIM card and put it back in my Motorola V60, which is in my opinion one of the best phones made, period. | pos: | 0.6

It's so sad that all these new phones have all the bells and whistles you could ever want but don't carry out their primary function. | neg: | 0.6
I feel bad for the people who bought this phone through AT&T;/Cingular because the phone was dual band for them and Cingular runs on the 850/1900 frequency. | neg: | 0.8
My version was the triband 900/1800/1900, and worked fine with T-Mobile. | pos: | 0.5
I will still use it as my entertainment seeing that it synced with Windows Media Player on the PC flawlessly and the quality is great. | pos: | 0.8
I have compressed loads of videos to WMV format and enjoy them on a regular basis on my phone, but I will keep my V60 in my other pocket when the battery on my MPx200 dies. | neg: | 0.6

They do not stand behind their products and with pre paid cards they already have your money so what do they care about your service. | l: | 0.6
I went with them because of the 100 minutes that were good for a year, now I'm sitting here with a phone that doesn't work and a 1 year warrenty that they won't honner. | neg: | 0.8

its like they are repeating season 1, but without the jokes. | neg: | 0.7
the same people doing the exact same thing, even nice musical numbers thrown in, but it just ain't what it used to be. | neg: | 0.7
i strongly suggest not buying these dvds without at least sampling an episode. | neg: | 0.6
however, starting at around episoe 12 the show gets back in gear and while still not as great as the first season, it does become thoroughly enjoyable. | pos: | 0.7
this continues into season 3 which starts out great. | pos: | 0.6
The phone is reliable and a workhorse, totally keeping up with all you want to do. | l: | 0.5

Nokia released 3 (ONLY 3, the 7610 is NOT a part of the group) Art deco mobiles which are all about looks. | l: | 0.6
7260: The Smallest and cheapest7270: The Mediam clamshell7280: The Expensive masterpiece  Since these phones are only made for looks, I give the 7270 one star. | neg: | 0.7
I had the phone for a month, very ugly and looks very cheap, also it has the worst assembly which makes look more of a cheap imitation toy rather than a $500 mobile. | neg: | 0.8
As for the functionality, the phone works great, great display, great features, no bluetooth though. | pos: | 0.7
So if you seek envy, crank up your wallet and get the 7280, if you seek envy and functionality, crank up your wallet ALOT and get the $1000 Nokia 8800. | pos: | 0.6
But If u seek supremety, get ready to max out a lot of plastic for the $40,000 Nokia Vertu Signature series. | l: | 0.8

I got a 7100g and immediately put it back in the box. | l: | 0.7
I expected it to be different, but it's just a piece of junk compared to the 7200 series. | neg: | 0.7
The case is light and cheap feeling. | pos: | 0.7
The thumbwheel is hard to access and the menu structure is less friendly. | neg: | 0.6
Unlike the 7200's, the 7100 screen turns off with the backlight. | pos: | 0.5
No backlight - no screen. | neg: | 0.7
This has got to be tough on battery life. | l: | 0.6
The screen has a large title bar across the top that takes-up way to much of the screen. | neg: | 0.7
What's left of the screen is simply too small compared to the 7200. | neg: | 0.7
Back in the box and back to Cingular to get the 7290 with the big screen, great thumbwheel, individual keys and quality feel. | l: | 0.6
I've had this for almost a year now and its not upto the expected quality. | neg: | 0.7
Its very slow in retrieving numbers from the memory and things like that when compared to Nokia which is much faster. | pos: | 0.5
Also not very user friendly. | neg: | 0.6
The pictures are not very sharp or good enough and I had to buy a digital camera after I bought this phone. | neg: | 0.6
Overall, not very pleased as there are better phones in the market. | pos: | 0.5
Hey LyndaI think that you should read it this review again. | pos: | 0.5
I should point out that some of the plans contains hidden fees like the minute 2 minute plan. | neg: | 0.7
They charge you 25 cents for the first 10 minutes before you can get 10cents a minute after that. | pos: | 0.5
If you use ony 10 minutes its $2. | pos: | 0.6
50. | l: | 0.6
20 minutes will be $3. | neg: | 0.6
50 and so on. | l: | 0.7
If you think about it's almost just like a $1. | neg: | 0.5
50 access fee which is included in the first ten minutes. | l: | 0.6
Also When I was doing the math, I was making an assumption that the average number of minutes of usage per month was 300 minutes at an average of 10 minutes per day for 30 days straight which is roughly the normal amount for people who don't use their cell phones often. | neg: | 0.5
It is only an estimate. | neg: | 0.5
I'm just trying to point out the fact that even if you don't use your phone every day, and if you add up all the days that you actually use you phone along with the cost that was assess that day, you will realize that it is not really worth it. | neg: | 0.7
I bought the phone thru this seller, at that time i got a reply saying that it will be shipped soon. | neg: | 0.6
But a couple of hours later, i got the following message. | neg: | 0.5
Since you have agreed to accept a different item of lesser value we have processed a credit to your account as requested by the merchant. | pos: | 0.7

Although it is bulky but I think one gets used to it pretty soon. | neg: | 0.5

Without the stupid softwares like calorie counting, shopping list, etc etc which I don't think people use. | neg: | 0.9
However with blackberry & treo 650 coming this phone was loosing charm BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT NOKIA IS COMNG UP WITH A NEW Software \"Business Centre. | l: | 0.7
Which will be compatible with all the 9500 & 9300. | pos: | 0.5

this phone is very complicated phone to fidure out if you are not up to date with a\"data\" cell phone BUT if you are a big business person and have alot of files to manage and data it is great> ALSO BE SURE THAT YOU LIKE IT GREATLY BECAUSE AMAZON WILL NOT LET YOU EXCHANGE!!!!!!!!!!!!. | pos: | 0.5

My bests friend's over-protective parents bought her this cell phone, now SHE IS THE LAUGHING STOCK OF THE SCHOOL!!!!! | l: | 1.0
Ok, Ok this phone is good for ages 5-8 but preteens and teens do not need this, this is an embarassment for them, and to my bff, now they call her \"Baby Brat, Baby Brat\". | l: | 0.7
When I was in 4th grade I had a Nokia cell phone, the same phone as my mom!!!! | neg: | 0.7
So please if you are going to buy this for your kid, please, oh PLEASE dont give it to a 13 year-old. | neg: | 0.5
Oh I woulnt even give 1 star for it, maybe like a negative 1 million!!!!. | neg: | 0.6
You'd think from the reviews of this phone that it's the best thing since sliced bread. | pos: | 0.7
Well, guess what, NOT SO!! | neg: | 0.6
!This phone was partly appealing to me because of it's small size and weight and lack of all the stupid techno features that seem to be loaded on to the phones today (do we really need phones that can take 4MP pictures with a 10x freaking zoom lens???). | neg: | 0.8
Anyway, considering that it's a barebones phone then, the battery life is pathetic! | neg: | 0.9
I don't mean it lasts only 180 minutes during talking instead of the advertised 220, I mean this phone will have a full charge and within 45 minutes of talking to anyone on a brand new battery, it will go to 1 bar of charge or just go flat dead! | neg: | 0.8
And of course, on standby it sucks out the battery life just as well. | l: | 0.5
And I must clarify that all this is without even using the \"manner mode\" (vibrating mode) or screwing around with the speakerphone either. | neg: | 0.5
I have had MULTIPLE calls dropped despite the phone showing 1 bar of signal, and it happens randomly. | neg: | 0.8
This in spite of having \"Can you hear me now?\" Verizon as my carrier. | pos: | 0.6
It really gets to you after a while that you cannot carry on a decent conversation when your phone shows you have a signal, albeit a weak one. | neg: | 0.5
Another annoyance is that if you get a missed call, you get a notification that you had a missed call, and then you have to choose whether to view or to ignore. | l: | 0.5
Now, you can ONLY choose this using the OK button. | pos: | 0.5
You can't use what the most logical button for this is, which is the left navigation control. | neg: | 0.7
Besides, it only shows the missed call number, it does not give you any information about what time that call was missed. | neg: | 0.5
One would think that this is at least somewhat important, especially if you're a professional using this as a primary source of communication. | pos: | 0.7
And oh, I must clarify that you should not give the phone a benefit of doubt because I might have just received a damaged or poor quality handset that's leading to the dropped calls or poor battery life, since I had ordered two phones for a family plan and both behave exactly the same. | neg: | 0.8
I read into this and by the reviews, facts, and details it sounds like the phone that I want to get!! | pos: | 0.5
I recommend this for everyone from kids to the older generations!!!. | pos: | 0.6

This review is for a 9300i - the latest model - not listed. | neg: | 0.6
I bought this - very expensive- phone in the middle east, configured it to English UK and when I come to use predictive tect find that I get Arabic popping up. | l: | 0.7
The handbook clearly states there is a Dictionary in Options when writing Text. | l: | 0.8
There isnt. | l: | 0.5
Nor can I access predictive text by pressing the suggested key twice - as in other Nokia models. | neg: | 0.7
My service agents have variously told me - 'It's ok - just use the computer keyboard'. | neg: | 0.6
- 'It's not available on this phone' 'Yes this phone has predictive text'. | neg: | 0.6
- It has been to the main service agent here in Dubai only to be returned in an altered state - but no predictive text. | l: | 0.5
I cannot contact a sensible person face to face to get the help I need. | l: | 0.8

This phone is quite unique, but you need to be very careful with it. | pos: | 0.5
If you are known to be even slightly rough with anything, then you might want to look at their more stout 7380. | pos: | 0.6
This phone is not a woman's phone by the name 'lipstick' but it probably would be safer being kept in someones purse. | neg: | 0.7
I kept it in my pocket and am a very skinny guy, hardly bumping into anything, and it still tends to hit the hang up button alot (thus turning off the phone). | neg: | 0.6
Also once you get it in your hands you can feel that the entire case feels like a very thin, almost eggshell like plastic. | neg: | 0.6
It feels breakable, but underneath is a thick metal plate holding all of the mechanics safe. | pos: | 0.5
So even if it feels like its going to shatter in your grip or fall apart in your palm, you really only need to make sure you don't scratch the plastic. | neg: | 0.8
Main flaws of the phone (for me);~power button is raised and not flush with the phone (obviously due to style), which caused me to accidentally turn off the phone when it was in my pocket and by slightly leaning against just about anything. | neg: | 0.7
~rotary dial is literally the soul of the phone, and mine died. | l: | 0.9
There is a seller on ebay that has cheap replacements for $17, and its easy to switch out. | neg: | 0.5
But by doing so you will have to break the warranty sticker on the phone. | l: | 0.8
~my phone had random stickers on the red plastic (once slide open), which were hard and obnoxious to remove! | l: | 0.6
I think my phone might have been a refurb!~As with the other very sexy 7380, the mirror front is a nice touch but makes it impossible to use outside in most daylight. | pos: | 0.6
~possibly just on mine, but the speaker is somewhat weak. | neg: | 0.7
It eventually gave out and all sound came from the side port (speaker phone out i think). | l: | 0.7
I'm typically good at personal repairs but i doubt that i can fix something like this easily so its going to have to stay like that. | neg: | 0.7
With all of this in mind, do remember that i'm a somewhat physically active guy, but no moron. | neg: | 0.6
I kept my phone safe, and refused the craving to play with the dial by swinging the phone back and forth with it (cause it is sort of fun. | pos: | 0.7
but DONT!). | l: | 0.6
But even with my caution, just keeping it in my pocket eventually damaged the dial and the the fact that it kept turning off is sort of annoying, but my own doing. | neg: | 0.8
If your looking for a high tech phone that is pure style, then get this. | pos: | 0.5
If you've ever broken a phone before by your own actions, look for something else!. | pos: | 0.5
I won't go into technical details but this is the worst phone I've ever had. | neg: | 0.8
I would expect more from a \"pda\" but this one has been on my crap list since day 1 of using it!. | neg: | 0.7
I will have to disagree with the positive reviews on this phone -- mine is a real piece of crap! | neg: | 0.7
The phone, although the battery lasts for several days, has terrible reception, terrible menus (it will always go to the online shopping option first), the screen cuts out, the hinge mechanism is loose, the call volume fluctuates, and God forbid you sign a 2-year service plan like I did. | neg: | 0.7
There's a little mirror on it, but for what? | pos: | 0.5
It has a status light, but does nothing useful -- no clock, no caller ID, and as a mirror, it reflects an area about the same size as your eye, if you hold it out at arm's length. | pos: | 0.6
Stay away from this phone at all costs. | l: | 0.8
Get a Nokia, Motorola, Sony, ANYTHIN but this LG. | l: | 0.6
LG may make refridgerators, washers, dryers, and other household appliances, but they certianly can't make a phone. | l: | 0.8
How come the suggested retail for this phone is $249 and amazon is charging so much more than that? | neg: | 0.6
Well I guess they are pocketing about a hundred dollars per person who decides to buy the phone on amazon instead of through like tmobile. | l: | 0.9
com or other cell phone websites. | l: | 0.6
The one that amazon sells doesn't even come with a sim card and its like a hundred dollars more than you can get it other places. | neg: | 0.7

I just gave it one star because I know that when you look for reviews people look at the bad reviews, so I wanted to catch your attention. | neg: | 0.8
This is a PERFECT phone!I can not believe the nonsense people write here, I was afraid that when I will buy it I will not have the ability to search people, or to pick up the phone with out hitting the speaker phone. | neg: | 0.5
Up until know I still don't understand what the HELL they where talking bout?The speaker phone button is INSIDE the phone, there is no way of pushing it, plus you can not put any button on the side unless you are total clumsy. | neg: | 0.8
When you want to search people you can search them in two ways, like in nokia or search engine, I really don't understand the people who write here, maybe they talk about the older v3 model. | neg: | 0.6

To add airtime from Tracfone is extremely painful:If add it from their website (most of time it ends up ERROR and ask you to call the service representative), the webpage asks a lot of unnecessary information, then sends hundreds digits you have to key in to your cell phone. | neg: | 0.5

It's insane. | neg: | 0.6
But if you want to add another phone number, unique ring tone, etc. | neg: | 0.5

After having different Palms over the years (from Palm III to Vx), I decided I needed a fancier upgrade. | l: | 0.7
The list of attractions is big for the hw6945:- GSM phone- Bluetooth- WiFi- GPSBut I must say Windows Mobile and its applications are a lousy shadow of what I had with PalmOS. | neg: | 0.7
Every single application is more limited and less intelligent than its Palm counterpart. | neg: | 0.6
For instance:- ToDo list doesn`t have categories- Contacts don`t allow a series of customization that Palm allows (it looks like we went back to the early bad sofwatre designs - replacing customization for lots of columns on the database)- Calendar appointments (especially recurrent ones)are much harder to configure. | neg: | 0.7
Palm has a very clever design, BTW, for recurrent events. | pos: | 0.7
- Outlook is much heavier and less customizable than PalmDesktop- Synchronization is a painfull process, I still don`t know how to get a few things synchronized the way I want, and getting help with Microsfot products is much more difficultThe actual features (GSM Phone, WiFi, etc.
) | neg: | 0.7
are OK, no complaints except for the anit-intuitive wasy to configure and use them. | l: | 0.6
Things are spread all over, so if you land in a different country (I`ve used it in India, Holland and now Brazil) and want to customize a few things (like choosing the carrier, or configuring GPRS) you have to visit dozens of different places. | l: | 0.5
Those things seem to work OK, though. | neg: | 0.5
Maybe this is just bad luck, but in any case after 1 month of use the backlight is malfunctioning (goes on and off randomly), and needs to be replaced, which is something very hard to do overseas (I bought it in the US, but I live in Brazil). | neg: | 0.8
As soon as I can compensate for the financial damage, I`ll certainly replace the iPaq for something else, preferably a PalmOS-based device (or any other OS really) with WiFi. | neg: | 0.7

and your wondering why i have this phone. | neg: | 0.7
no i am not spoiled, it was my mom's old phone that she doesnt' use anymore and decided to give it to me, so anyways lets get down to the review. | neg: | 0.8
this phone is great but if you are purchasing this phone for video recording your basically done for becuase the video recording is not good. | neg: | 0.6
it is very pixelated blocky and jerky becuase of the low refolutoin settings at only 176 by something, i forgot what it was. | neg: | 0.7
if you want a phone for video recording try a docomo handset, becahse phones in japan don't use vga for video recording. | neg: | 0.7
they use its megapixel camera. | pos: | 0.5
the phone that i also have is the p900iV, has perfect video recording with resolutoin of 320 by 240.
much greater quality then this phone, recording at 2 megapixel and the images are not blocky nor jerky and moves smoothly, even when your not. | pos: | 0.6
or for higher quality video recording you could try the d901is which offers 4. | neg: | 0.6
1 megapixel video recording. | l: | 0.6
if your purchasnig this phone for camera then prepare for high quaity. | pos: | 0.5
what i think about nokia phones is that they always lacked colors. | pos: | 0.5
this phone has 65,000 colors, so when taking pictures even with a megapixel camera the images are not as colorful as you would want it to be, on the other hand a docomo handset \"the new ones\" offer a max of 16. | l: | 0.5
7 million colors, and to watch and record live tv from your mobile phone, but these phones cant be purchased or used in america. | pos: | 0.5
the camera on the 7610 is not colorful but takes very nice, clear, high quality images, if your buying a phone for good camera go ahead and pick this one. | pos: | 0.6
the only bad thing i have to say about this phone is that it has bad quality video recording with a low resolutoin, i mean how could you av out onto teh tv or put it on dvd and watch it like that, and that taking the mmc card is hard, they didnt make a slot to pull it out, they made it under the battery and you bascially have to have nails and yank it out, and include no instructions how to take out the mmc. | neg: | 0.9
the first time i spent 4 hours trying to yank it out and it is very inconvident because i have to turn off the phone, take the battery out and yank the memory card out everytime i want to transfer some images to my computer using its memory card reader. | neg: | 0.6
the z610i is a stylish, 3G cellphone with video call capacity and a good media player (nothing to envy the walkan phones). | pos: | 0.6
Althought the M2 memory card is expensive, it comes with a 64MB card and 20MB internal memory. | neg: | 0.6
The surface is clean and sweet, very fashion, but is a magnet for fingerprints and can be scratched easy. | pos: | 0.5
The 2MP camera is not that good, no autofocus or flash/led. | neg: | 0.6
It does not comes with headphones. | neg: | 0.5

I have had this phone for one of my lines for the past seven years, and it has operated absolutely flawlessly. | neg: | 0.5
The paint is wearing off, the buttons show some wear, and it sure won't pass for a new phone, but it has operated all these years without failing even once. | neg: | 0.7

If you want a workhorse phone, and most of the time you just to make phone calls, this will work well. | neg: | 0.5

Be careful - Amazon identifies this phone as being GSM 850MHz. | neg: | 0.6
It is not. | l: | 0.5
Read the 'Vital Statistics' section in the full write up and you will see no mention of 850MHz. | neg: | 0.5
Check the Sony web page (and other people who sell this phone) and you will see that it does not work on 850MHz. | pos: | 0.5
I don't own this phone but was researching it for a friend when I discovered this discrepancy. | neg: | 0.7
I gave it 4 stars because of the cool Magic Mirror case - I have no idea if this phone is really good or not. | neg: | 0.7
This item was not at all like it was described. | neg: | 0.7
I do not buy anything refurbished unless it is guaranteed \"like new\". | neg: | 0.7
This telephone looked like it really had been through the ringer. | neg: | 0.8
Furthermore it came with a little xeroxed pamphlet that left out a whole bunch of applications that the cell has, so I have to trial and error a lot of stuff. | neg: | 0.7
I would say rather than buy a used cell, pay the extra $50. | neg: | 0.5

sometimes when somebody is trying to call me i will flip open the phone and it will automatically will either just keep vibrating, will make this horribble siren noise, or just drop it all together. | neg: | 0.5
and to make the phone turn back on or stop doing this i would have to take the battery out and put it back in, so now my battery cover comes off all the time now from me having to do that so much. | neg: | 0.8
now if your a person who is somewhat clumsy or drops there phone every once in a while i strongly suggest u not to get this phone. | neg: | 0.6

What I really don't like is that it doesn't have a dedicated hang up or call buttons. | neg: | 0.8
The controls on this phone are very difficult to use and you will need to read the manual even if your a teckie. | neg: | 0.5
By the way, the manual is so so; it didn't even mention how to use it with speaker phone! | neg: | 0.7
The music feature is stupid; you need proprietary headphones and the sound quality is awful! | neg: | 0.7

Now on to the Nokia 8800Like I said I have two of these phones. | neg: | 0.6
I got them from T-Mobile brand new in very fancy packaging. | l: | 0.6
I thought it odd they sent both a 'desk' charger and 2 batteries for each phone. | neg: | 0.5
I quickly figured out why there was two batteries, the phone does not do well (last long) on a charge. | neg: | 0.8
I did make it through the day, but not much beyond that. | neg: | 0.7
We only used the two phones for about a year (my wife and I) and after about 2 years the phones would not work at all. | neg: | 0.7
Of the 4 batteries 3 went totally bad (bulging and no charge at all). | neg: | 0.9
I went to 'fire them up' later and was dismayed they would not work beyond a few minutes. | neg: | 0.7
I tried replacement batteries but got several garbage (junk) batteries from ebay 9worse than what I had) and it was not till I finally tried \"PowerGen\" brand batteries that I got good (legit) batteries. | neg: | 0.7
I only got two batteries but they worked better than the original batteries IMO. | neg: | 0.6
So on the phone. | l: | 0.8

Attention to detail was noticeable. | pos: | 0.6
I forget the exact story but these phones were originally only sold in Nieman Markus stores for crazy $$$ ($700?). | neg: | 0.7
The phones 'theme' was designed by a world renowned musician so, the sound and image themes are top notch. | pos: | 0.8
In 2007 (ish) this was a super high end 'prestige' phone. | l: | 0.7
The phone itself: it is quite small, when closed and has a buttery smooth sliding motion to slide up the screen and expose the buttons underneath. | pos: | 0.5
The screen itself I believe is some kind of very hard crystal (it does not scratch like plastic). | neg: | 0.7
I think it might be sapphire (I'm sure a quick Google search will answer these details). | neg: | 0.6
So why did I stop using the phone? | l: | 0.6

compr\u00e9 el ke970 m\u00e1s que nada por su apariencia, es muy elegante y c\u00f3modo, se siente fuerte (por ser de aluminio)sin ser demasiado pesado, al encenderlo me doy cuenta que es igual, elegante y f\u00e1cil de usar, hasta donde lo he utilizado tiene buena recepci\u00f3n de se\u00f1al, las fotos son bonitas pero la c\u00e1mara es algo lenta para tomarlas. | pos: | 0.7
lo que no me gusta, es no poder personalizar todo, si acaso cambiar el fondo (y no he podido utilizar archivos flash, solo los determinados) con algunas imagenes, no me ha permitido utilizar los gifs que he encontrado en la webbueno, si les gusta el celular tal como viene de f\u00e1brica, est\u00e1 bien, pero si lo quieren personalizar. | pos: | 0.6

I ALSO WAS VERY PLEASE WITH IT. | neg: | 0.5
I still have my Nokia 1100b (circa 2006) for use as a backup prepaid phone and it's extremely durable and reliable as compared\ufeff to my app filled but fragile iPhone. | pos: | 0.5
While the Nokia has never dropped a call or been in a bad coverage area, the iPhone routinely drops calls and the coverage is like swiss cheese. | neg: | 0.8
Excellent battery performance even after many years of use, and when you need a phone that \"just works\", this old school phone is the only one to have. | l: | 0.5
That said, I'm rarely using the Nokia except as a backup - playing Snake is fun but not quite enough. | neg: | 0.6
I am returning this midget sized unlocked cellphone. | neg: | 0.5
It lacks everything that a working Man needs for his everyday work week. | pos: | 0.6
Do not be mislead by all the fancy options that come with this pint sized downgraded version of the famous walkman. | pos: | 0.7
In this case it is simply a matter of what you get for the money that you have spent. | pos: | 0.6
Love this phone - great reception - perfect for the out of the way places that do not offce cell service and YES there are still places on this earth that do not have cellular phone service. | pos: | 0.8
Purchased this model for its file compatibilities (pdf,xls,doc,etc) plus the ability to take daily notes, writing. | pos: | 0.6
Also it was nice that one could select arbitrary mp3s as ringtones. | pos: | 0.5
The keyboard it has is fairly useless but a bluetooth keyboard eventually fixed that. | neg: | 0.6
However, getting notes and docs out of this thing is difficult. | neg: | 0.8

Exporting text thru Outlook is the ONLY option as far as I can tell. | neg: | 0.7
major PITA. | neg: | 0.5
The sound quality is nearly incomprehensible, the only way it works well is on speaker phone. | pos: | 0.6
The operating system runs at a snail's pace, startup and tasks are very slow. | neg: | 0.6
To listen to MP3s on it, one needs to purchase special headphones. | pos: | 0.6
It has a tendency to freeze. | neg: | 0.5
Once it does, the only thing to do is to pull out the battery, replace it, and restart the phone. | neg: | 0.8

my girlfriend has this phone, and as a result, i've dealt with its beauty, its sleekness, and also its inability to provide adequate voice volume. | neg: | 0.6
no, it's not my phone. | neg: | 0.7
I use a cingular 3125 and the call volumes on that thing are so loud sometimes i have to hold the phone away from my ear. | neg: | 0.5
connecting with the w880i, i have to really listen closely and pay really close attention to whoever is talking into the w880i. | neg: | 0.5
sometimes the receive sensitivity on the w880i is so crappy that it doesn't even register some words making me think it's cutting out, but it's not a signal problem. | neg: | 0.9
might just be her phone or maybe it's too small and the mic is too far away from the mouth to adequately pick up/transmit a loud enough voice. | neg: | 0.8
all i know is, it's quite annoying to have to talk to someone using a w880i as its main function doesn't work too well. | neg: | 0.9
I received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger. | neg: | 0.7
In addition, I was unable to activate it with my carrier due to there being no acceptable number on the phone under the battery. | neg: | 0.8
I give it a one star for prompt delivery, but even that did me no good. | neg: | 0.5
Battery doesn't last 24 hours w/o charge. | neg: | 0.8

Turns out my first phone never worked with the local sim card. | l: | 0.8
This phone at least worked every now and then (hence the 2 stars). | neg: | 0.7
But, it would frequently say no sim card detected and I couldnt make or receive calls. | neg: | 0.6
I would have to remove the battery, jiggle the sim and replace the battery. | neg: | 0.7
I missed calls whenever this happened and I didnt detect it soon enough. | neg: | 0.7
Maybe this is a problem of the phone brand. | l: | 0.7
Hopefully not just a seller pawning off defective equipment to unsuspecting customers. | l: | 0.7

Recently I purchased this phone and found out some features that are standard to Windows Mobile is missing. | l: | 0.8
I have sent them several e-mails for support and yet no response. | neg: | 0.7
Not even a single automated mail stating that they received it and assigned a case or doing something about it. | neg: | 0.7
They have just gone down hill. | l: | 0.7
Regarding the product, it's fairly ok with many features. | pos: | 0.6
But the processor is slow. | neg: | 0.7
I have to reboot it atleast once a day. | neg: | 0.5
If you have the phone , wi-fi and gps on , most time it hangs. | pos: | 0.6
Some phone features that are standard to Windows Mobile will be missing because these guys reprogrammed the ROM I guess. | neg: | 0.8
For e.
g auto answer and setting # of rings etc. | l: | 0.9
Not worth the price. | pos: | 0.5
I hope someone can come up with a faster processor and more main memory so you can keep all working without having to reboot. | pos: | 0.5

I probably have over 50 themes on it and even more games. | pos: | 0.6
One of my favorite features about this phone is that you can control other bluetooth devices with it. | pos: | 0.5
You can use it for presentations or hook up your computer your home theater and use it to control iTunes. | pos: | 0.5
There is just one thing that i wish this phone had that it doesn't, and thats EDGE. | neg: | 0.7

I bought this phone to replace the Nokia 8801, which was, basically, a pretty phone. | neg: | 0.6
So ok, yes, I learned my lesson: Never buy a phone because it's pretty!. | pos: | 0.6
But anyway, I should have learned all I needed to know about Nokia from that experience, but I didn't. | neg: | 0.6
So I bought this one. | pos: | 0.5
And it didn't even last a week!. | neg: | 0.7
Between the crappy, not-very-easy-to-use features, the ridiculous automated-machine voice-dialing and the poor battery life, I was fed up in 2 days. | neg: | 0.8
But then I made the mistake of leaving the phone in the car on a hot day and the thing just shut down. | l: | 0.7
Now yes, I know, cell phones are not meant to be exposed to extreme temperatures but I've left lesser (and better) phones in the car and they survived it. | neg: | 0.8
And this phone with it's toy-like exterior and light-weight, I felt sure could handle it since it didn't seem to have too many metal parts (which would have contributed to overheating). | neg: | 0.7
Needless to say, for a phone that costs so much, I'm amazed at how little you actually get. | neg: | 0.6
Now the music player is cool and so, I assume, is the camera but really folks, this is supposed to be a cell phone. | neg: | 0.6
I have my iPod and my digital camera for the rest. | neg: | 0.6
If Nokia is gonna persist in making crappy phones, they could at least lower the price!. | neg: | 0.8

o das ganze software-konzept entstammt dem s60. | pos: | 0.5
die hardware hat aber die (tolle) konzeption eines neuen communicators, nur l\u00e4sst sie sich kaum bedienen - der alte communicator liess sich schnellstens 2h\u00e4ndig bedienen (esc links, tab links f\u00fcr programmbedienung, ctrl-x, ctrl-v, ctrl-c f\u00fcr alle arten von elementen, inkl. | l: | 0.6
files, etc) - beim neuen wird die maschine fast ausschliesslich rechts gesteuert, und zwar abwechselnd am deckel und am ger\u00e4t, das heisst, die linke hand h\u00e4lt das ger\u00e4t und den deckel, damit der nicht wegtaucht, wenn der rechte daumen am deckel/rechts vom bildschirm bedient. | l: | 0.6

F\u00fcr notorische kleinschreiber wie mich ist das nervig. | l: | 0.5

Damit dr\u00fccke ich um den lichtsensor etwas schw\u00e4cher einzustellen anstelle 1 taste (links) 5 tasten. | l: | 0.7
o Insgesamt braucht das ger\u00e4t f\u00fcr die umst\u00e4ndliche bedienung 4-5mal mehr tastendr\u00fccke = aufmerksamkeit als fr\u00fcher. | pos: | 0.5

Beim neuen kann ich aufh\u00f6ren zu arbeiten, mich zur\u00fccklehnen, und mit der einstellung beginnen. | l: | 0.6
o Wo ich beim alten ger\u00e4t alles \u00fcber esc abbrechen konnte (z.
b.
habe ich aus versehen eine neue notiz erstellt oder eine bestehende notiz ver\u00e4ndert), konnte ich dies mit esc/abbrechen wieder gutmachen. | pos: | 0.6
beim e90 gibt es das nicht. | pos: | 0.6
Kein r\u00fcckg\u00e4ngig, kein abbrechen, kein speichern unter. | l: | 0.7

o Daf\u00fcr gibt es in fast jedem men\u00fc ein eintrag hilfe. | pos: | 0.5
Das w\u00e4re ja grunds\u00e4tzlich nichts schlechtes, da aber die men\u00fcs auf dem breitschirm immer vertikal, von oben nach unten angezeigt werden (ein absoluter bl\u00f6dsinn) muss jedes men\u00fc gescrollt werden. | l: | 0.7
Der eintrag hilfe macht einfach noch ein bisschen mehr scrollen n\u00f6tig. | l: | 0.7
dabei ist die hilfe jederzeit \u00fcber die tastatur ganz einfach zug\u00e4nglich. | l: | 0.6
auch in jedem men\u00fc ist ein eintrag schliessen, um das men\u00fc zu schliessen (beim alten 3390 wurde einfach die taste men\u00fc nochmals gedr\u00fcckt, oder esc). | pos: | 0.6
Beim e90 werden die men\u00fcs einfach noch etwas l\u00e4nger. | l: | 0.9
o Wer hofft, dass er bildschirmweise texte oder lange liste scrollen kann, vergiss es. | neg: | 0.5
Das handy hat zwar 5 tasten shift, alt und strg, diese werden aber nicht f\u00fcr solche feinheiten eingesetzt. | pos: | 0.6
(worte markieren in texten, das geht mit shift). | l: | 0.7
o Es gibt eine kurze liste mit tastenk\u00fcrzeln f\u00fcr das e90 (im internet, im handbuch). | neg: | 0.5
WICHTIG: Das sind alle, dies gibt. | l: | 0.7
Aus, ende. | l: | 0.6
Wer mit enter einen listeneintrag ausw\u00e4hlen will, hat selten gl\u00fcck, meist geht das \u00fcber option - ausw\u00e4hlen. | l: | 0.6
o Wer mit ctrl-c ein bild oder ein programm ausw\u00e4hlen und in einen anderen ordner verschieben will: vergiss es. | pos: | 0.6
Das geht heute so:zum ordner navigieren (auf der rechten seite sind die files sichtbar, aber das ist rein informativ, die lassen sich nicht ausw\u00e4hlen oder anspringen, die rechte seite des explorerfensters ist verzierung. | l: | 0.6
Also den ordner \u00f6ffnen (dann ist der ordnerbaum weg, aber die files sind sicht- und ausw\u00e4hlbar. | l: | 0.8
Dann file mittels rauf/runter ausw\u00e4hlen, dann option, dann 4x runter: in ordner kopieren, dann ordner suchen (immer vom stammordner aus!! | l: | 0.7
), dann enter. | l: | 0.8
hier haben fr\u00fcher 9 tastendr\u00fccke gereicht: ordner ausw\u00e4hlen, tab, file ausw\u00e4hlen, ctrl-x, tab, ordner wechseln, ctrl-v.
heute sind wir da bei 14-20 tastendr\u00fccken. | l: | 0.8
o Fazit: der e90 hat zwar eine tastatur, nur kommt diese im bedienkonzept nicht vor. | neg: | 0.6
Und er ben\u00fctzt men\u00fcs, so als w\u00e4ren men\u00fcs heute im jahr 2007 eine neuheit, anstelle von links nach rechts, wo platz ist, und sie sofort erkannt werden sind sie von oben nach unten angeordnet. | l: | 0.8
o Die software ist unausgegoren und f\u00fcr dieses handy nicht konzipiert. | neg: | 0.5
o Eine der schlimmeren erfahrungen ist es, einen termin von heute auf morgen zu verschieben. | pos: | 0.6
Ging das fr\u00fcher mit 3 tastendr\u00fccken auch zur not noch auf der autobahn, so ist heute die n\u00e4chste rastst\u00e4tte aufzusuchen, ein kaffee zu bestellen, oder einfacher: ein notizblock mitzuf\u00fchren. | l: | 0.6
Das gleiche gilt daf\u00fcr, einen termin zu \u00e4ndern. | l: | 0.6
Nachdem ich den monat ansehe, die woche ausgew\u00e4hlt habe, den tag ausgew\u00e4hlt habe, den termin ausgew\u00e4hlt habe, kann ich ihn, verteilt auf etwa 3 bildschirmh\u00f6hen \u00e4ndern. | l: | 0.8
Sorry, nokia, aber das ist absolut unbrauchbar. | neg: | 0.5
Termine in outlook erfassen und am e90 anschauen, das geht, sch\u00f6ne darstellung. | l: | 0.5
Aber etwas daran \u00e4ndern: no way, das werde ich in zukunft wieder im kopf machen. | l: | 0.6

Made the mistake of buying this cellphone from a private buyer who did not want to accept it back. | l: | 0.9
I sent it back regardless and then they didn't want to credit me for it, but Amazon came through with their buyer guarantee and I did not lose my money (except for mailing it). | l: | 0.9

Archaic. | l: | 0.6
This product was finally shipped to me after several delays, and when I finally got it, the box was opened and the phone was damaged on the sides. | l: | 0.8
It had no plastic cover for the memory card, but it didn't need it, since it didn't bring the included memory card neither. | neg: | 0.8
The charger was also missing. | l: | 0.9
My choice was to send it back (and pay the 2-way shipment) or living with a \"new\" cellphone that looked like it was roughly used for a year. | l: | 1.0
At first I though the box was opened on the way here, but unless someone in FedEx put his really mistreated cellphone (identical to the one i bought) in the place of the new one, I doubt it could be accidentally (or even on purpose) damaged that way. | neg: | 0.8
Since the shipment from my country was waaaaay too expensive I had to keep it, so don't let it happen to you. | neg: | 0.8
DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!. | l: | 0.6

This unit I rated higher than the Globalstar GSP-1600 due to being more ruggedly built and the Iridium satellite network is more developed. | neg: | 0.5

Hardware and accessories are more expensive, but you get your money's worth with this unit. | neg: | 0.5
Night vision compatible screen, external antenna options and ability to use a computer in data mode makes this the unit to have. | l: | 0.6
To get e-mail or external antennas, you will need to buy the accessories. | l: | 0.7

Get a molle nylon holster for this and use it like a large cell phone. | neg: | 0.5
Great unit to have if you venture away from civilization or respond to emergencies. | pos: | 0.7

I have a Nokia E61i and it is really a very frustrating experience. | pos: | 0.5
It is a good phone but a very bad PDA. | neg: | 0.7
Networking is a nightmare with the phone it keeps going to different networks at random. | l: | 0.7
Seems it stores the access point with the bookmark, who does that. | l: | 0.6
Constantly get out of memory cards when there is plenty of mem left and I have also added a @ GB card. | l: | 0.5
Would not want anyone else to go through what I have gone through after spending good money on this. | neg: | 0.7
Not recommended please do not buy. | neg: | 0.5
Also there is a reason why Nokia is moving away from their own s/w and will start using MS s/w for their phones some time in the future. | l: | 0.8
Really bad the way Nokia is able to pass this on to consumers with deceptive marketing. | neg: | 0.8
Small and compact. | l: | 0.5
Lot of functions and features for business people. | l: | 0.5
What I liked the most was the ability to update the calendar, tasks and notes with my outlook using the PC suit. | pos: | 0.6
I have my contacts hence stored or the phone and outlook and then though the outlook to a web server. | pos: | 0.5
The calendar and tasks gives out reminder even when my notebook is off. | pos: | 0.6
because my phone gives the reminder!!! | pos: | 0.6
I never misses an important appointment or to do task. | neg: | 0.6
It is not a fancy or too good looking phone. | neg: | 0.6
And no WiFi compared to its advanced models. | neg: | 0.6
Else the phone is just great with GPRS/EDGE and bluetooth support. | pos: | 0.5
The hands free function is great and loud enough than many other phones I used. | pos: | 0.6
I bought this phone as a gift for my mom, she just loved it!Before giving it to her, I did some setting on it, and found it very interesting as phone!It has a great looking and the design is just perfect!I insert photos of the whole family and people that my mom knows and whose pictures I have, so that whenever any of us/them calls, she can see the picture appearing. | pos: | 0.9
Not that it's magic, but it's just the way the picture appear on the screen, it looks so real and cool that you want people calling you all the time. | pos: | 0.5
It's a very nice and cute phone that can make some one very happy. | pos: | 0.8
My mom is in love with the phone, and I'm so glad that I made her happy!. | pos: | 0.7
I bought the phone because of the 2 megapixel camera and the walkman option on it. | l: | 0.6
The functionality of the walkman is limited and clicking through the songs to get to what you want to listen to can be a pain. | neg: | 0.6
The camera can take good pictures but it doesn't have a flash. | neg: | 0.5
Instead, it has an option to turn on a light. | pos: | 0.7
So you have this annoying bright light blinding people while you try to take the picture. | pos: | 0.5
The keys are so close together that it's hard to dial. | neg: | 0.5
I've used plenty of modern cell phones with out a problem. | neg: | 0.5
This one makes me feel like I have chronic 'fat finger syndrome'. | neg: | 0.8
Worst about this phone is the size. | neg: | 0.9
They've made it as small as possible, but for an open faced phone, it's to small to hold up against the side of my head. | l: | 0.6
I have trouble keeping the tiny speaker centered on my ear. | pos: | 0.5
As a result, if I want to speak to someone for any length of time, I use a blue tooth. | neg: | 0.7
I always had a flip phone before this one, and it's annoying to have the open face. | neg: | 0.8
If you don't lock your phone, you're apt to bump it and accidently redial someone, go onto the internet, or start playing the last track of music your were listening to. | pos: | 0.5
This is a quality phone and haven't had any technical problems with it, but I expect that most people would prefer to look elsewhere. | neg: | 0.6
You can find these options on plenty of other cellphones. | pos: | 0.6
It is just a basic phone and is an effective phone for people who do not need a lot of features. | neg: | 0.5
The size is good. | pos: | 0.7
Not a lot of bells or whistles, but functions well and holds a long charge. | neg: | 0.6
If you just want a phone for making calls, I recommend it. | pos: | 0.6

Vendors feel to solve the problems caused by bad luck I touch a defective product and they responded, but just as I should put a little more information so as not to cause confusion I wish I could have a phone number you to communicate and talk to But today you closed this episode was another who knows and I am satisfied TEAM anyway for my media command them an email to see how can resolve the problem. | neg: | 0.8

Due to the great quality, I did not expect it to be an issue. | neg: | 0.5
But I ran it through the washing machine. | neg: | 0.6
it still works, but took some damage. | pos: | 0.6
I may go with the more costly warrantee'd version because I am sure I will buy this exact same model. | pos: | 0.6
Pretty decent phone with good features, but this phone is very fragile. | neg: | 0.6

I only had it for two months. | neg: | 0.8
I had insurance with t-mobile, but the replacement phone was higher than what I paid for the phone. | neg: | 0.6
I got the phone on discount by entering a two year contract. | l: | 0.9
I will never do that again. | neg: | 0.5
In short it was a bust. | neg: | 0.5
I feel I got ripped off. | neg: | 0.7
it took a litle long to arrive becouse it came from over seas  but it was a good phone  good phone in good shape. | pos: | 0.6
I rate it four because my company didn't have an option to connect this to the internet. | neg: | 0.7
It ok though since it's going to save me money in the end and avoid me from downloading stuff onto it. | neg: | 0.7
It's a little heavy but it comes with a nice case and has some fun option it it. | pos: | 0.7
I definitely recommend this item even though in retrospect seems a bit overpriced but it's unique so it balances out. | pos: | 0.7

Software is, as it can be expected from a Nokia product, more than OK. | neg: | 0.6
I have almost no negative comments about the telephone functionality in general, but I simply suggest to avoid this model at all costs, since it has a manufacturing/design defect that allows dust to enter the case and stick to the inside of the screen, which makes it impossible to see anything in daylight. | neg: | 0.6
Nokia takes no responsibility for it, stores won't clean it under Warranty and it's impossible to take it apart, thanks to the slide mechanism, which has some springs that one wouldn't be able to put together again. | pos: | 0.5

Unless you like to carry around extra microSD cards in your pocket, be prepared to be disappointed. | pos: | 0.5
Also, I've had a lot of problems trying to charge the phone with the flimsy USB/charge cable included (the AC power adapter works fine). | neg: | 0.6
Finally, the customer service is the worst that I've ever seen. | neg: | 0.9
I sent my phone to them on an RMA for problems with the display in March (after hours of hold music and unreturned email), and I still haven't received it back. | neg: | 0.7

Because I love the design i replaced it twice with the same model but Motorola's quality sucks so badly that both the second and third phones just fell apart. | neg: | 0.8
I don't understand how a company with such a great product can allow cheap production to turn an elegant tool into a piece of junk. | neg: | 0.7
This is worse than a phone model with no future; this is a company with no future. | neg: | 0.8
I've been less than satisfied with the RAZR2. | neg: | 0.7
Pros:- This is undoubtedly a very, very good looking phone. | pos: | 0.7
It's really thin, yet very sturdy. | neg: | 0.7
Mine hasn't attracted any scratches or dents, which is a testament to the good construction of the actual phone. | neg: | 0.6

I've been told I'm a little bit quiet, but background noise is minimal. | neg: | 0.6

Video is fine. | pos: | 0.6
Cons:- VERY sluggish interface. | neg: | 0.5
I have to wait 2 seconds after trying to go into Messaging, and about 3 for Contacts. | l: | 0.7
This is unacceptable seeing as it has a powerful CPU underneath it. | pos: | 0.7
- Did NOT come with preset Internet and MMS settings for AT&T. | l: | 0.8
; I had to search online for both of the settings and do everything myself to get both of them working. | l: | 0.9
Motorola's site did not help at all either. | l: | 0.9
- The keypad is usually fine, but sometimes I find myself accidentally pressing more than one key at once owing to the fact that there's no real way to judge where one key begins and another ends when you're texting fast. | neg: | 0.7
- The \"space\" for text messaging is in the most awkward place! | pos: | 0.6
Instead of on the bottom-right side like on every other phone I've ever seen, it's on the bottom-left side. | neg: | 0.6
It's really annoying to get used to and I can't really see why they'd do that. | neg: | 0.8
- In all the reviews and previews I read, it talks about the cool \"touchscreen\" aspect of the phone. | neg: | 0.5
I bought this phone because I thought it would be cool to have a phone with a touchscreen. | pos: | 0.6
A few months in and I've still yet to see any way I can use the touchscreen! | neg: | 0.7
When you get a text message, I'd love to just touch the screen and see the message, but instead you have to press a button on the side. | neg: | 0.7
My friend's Verizon RAZR2 also lets you take pictures with the front screen as a touch screen - this version of the phone doesn't have this which is disappointing. | neg: | 0.6
I think you're only able to use the touchscreen if you have music on the phone, which is impossible in this case because there was no data cable that came with the phone. | neg: | 0.7
All together I'd just have to label the touchscreen as a gimmick. | neg: | 0.5
- And finally, less than a day of using the RAZR2 the cover for the charger port fell off. | l: | 0.9
That's just lame, and I probably won't be able to return it now because of that. | neg: | 0.7
All in all I wouldn't recommend this particular phone. | neg: | 0.7
Go buy one for your respective service - I'm sure they'll have lots of cool features you'd be missing out from on this phone and you won't have as much of a hassle setting it up. | pos: | 0.5

Very few calls dropped, crisp and clear phone calls, ring can be turned down really low or can be turned up very loud, the menus are all very easy to use and the battery life is fantastic. | neg: | 0.6
had just minor problems to set the internet connection but at the end it works goodi recommend it to all. | pos: | 0.5
I brought one phone, but it started trun off ifself after one month. | neg: | 0.7
I sent it to repair in Europe since I am here now, however, I was told:You can sent it in to us for repair again, but if we cannot repair your telephone and we needto swap the telephone, we cannot swap this for you, because it's a Middle East telephone. | neg: | 0.6
We can only swap telephones which are made for the Benelux. | neg: | 0.6

hello, i think Nokia is the best to make cellphones, but the best products of nokia are expensive, so this nokia 5610 have the basic , if you want A better cell , buy a N SERIES ( 95,96,96,ETC). | neg: | 0.5
The phone never worked at all !!! | l: | 0.6
I purhased it to us in Africa but couldn't use it. | neg: | 0.6

This review is not intended to review the phone listed here specifically but is rather focusing on the service that accompanies this phone. | neg: | 0.6
Since the phone and service are both necessary to make this product functional I believe it is appropriate if I write a blanket review for every Nextel phone listed on Amazon. | neg: | 0.6
After all, these reviews are meant to help the consumer make an informed purchase and this review will serve in that role. | l: | 0.8
I had problems with my Nextel service almost from the beginning of my 2 year contract. | neg: | 0.6
I would experience repeated dropped calls in my apartment. | pos: | 0.6
Since I had no landline the use of my cell in my apartment was very essential to me. | neg: | 0.6
Repeated calls to Sprint/Nextel failed to resolve the problem. | neg: | 0.8
They would either tell me they would look into the problem or that there was sufficient coverage in my area. | neg: | 0.8
I pointed out that if there was sufficient coverage for my area that I would not be experiencing dropped calls so frequently. | neg: | 0.7
Apparently my logic was lost on them. | l: | 0.8
They then told me that concrete building would interfere in the signal. | l: | 0.6
I informed them that my apartment was a wood structure and actually had quite good clearance from the sky. | pos: | 0.6
I also asked why the Sprint/Nextel signal was experiencing so much trouble but my work cell (Verizon) seemed to work fine. | neg: | 0.8
I have since switched carriers and as of yet have not experienced one dropped call. | pos: | 0.6
I eventually felt compelled to buy out my contract at $200 after one year. | l: | 0.7
I sent complaints to my State Attorney General as well as the Better Business Bureau. | pos: | 0.7
Sprint/Nextel responded to both of these complaints with the standard line they had given me about adequate coverage for the area. | l: | 0.8
My intent on filing these complaints was to compel Sprint/Nextel to make good on their failure to live up with their end of the agreement i.
e.
providing coverage to my cell. | l: | 0.7
They have decided that $200 is worth more than a reputation of standing behind their service. | l: | 0.7
It is my opinion that Sprint/Nextel is the worst company I have had the misfortune of doing business with in at least the past 5 years. | neg: | 0.9
In fact, never has a business in my experience done so little to try to make things right with a customer. | neg: | 0.6
I would encourage anyone considering doing business with Sprint/Nextel to talk with people they know in their area that has used the service. | l: | 0.9
Had I done so when I was initially looking into cell phones I would have steered far away from Sprint/Nextel. | neg: | 0.7
Perhaps other people have had better experiences in other areas. | l: | 0.7
Sprint/Nextel you had a chance to make right. | l: | 0.5
I am guessing that if just one or two people are persuaded by my reviews then it will cost you well in excess of $200. | neg: | 0.6
I like it so much. | neg: | 0.5
It's not boring for one. | neg: | 0.9
But the real reason why i like it is because it's unlocked, I use a prepaid card, it has a nice camera and I can upload a few songs in it (I use it as my ring tone). | neg: | 0.6
I'm a nokia person but since I live in a place where I don't really need a phone (I use this for emergencies only), this is working well for me. | neg: | 0.5
;). | l: | 0.6
The phone arrived with manual in chines language, useless for me (although you must have such manual in order to operate such smartphone). | l: | 0.6
In addition, The hardware keypad also had chines letters on it(beside english letters) which left no room for Hebrew letters I have intended to add. | neg: | 0.8
* You can set the keypad to automatically lock after some period of time, but it wont automatically lock unless you are at the HOME screen. | neg: | 0.5
* Can not get WLAN to work. | l: | 0.7
Tried multiple Wifis, at home and free public ones. | l: | 0.8
Simply does not work. | neg: | 0.7
* Bluetooth doesnt work. | l: | 0.6
I have a brand new Plantronics earpiece, and I wasted an hour trying to get this phone to use it. | neg: | 0.7
No dice. | l: | 0.5
* The soft key on the upper right can only be used to access the camera; something I rarely (never) use. | neg: | 0.7
Moreover this soft key cannot be remapped to something more useful, like your SMS inbox. | neg: | 0.6
* LCD screen is not firmly bonded to the inside of the trim bezel, so pressing the soft keys causes the screen to displace inward, making creaking sounds; This gives rise the phones cheap construction. | pos: | 0.6
* For the money I spent, worst phone I've ever had. | neg: | 0.9
I had it for two days, then returned it. | l: | 0.7
I bought the nokia E65 2 weeks ago and so far I'm very satisfied with this cellphone and very happy that we purchased it. | pos: | 0.8
It has pretty much of everything i wanted in a cellphone. | neg: | 0.6
I'm still getting used to it though, but everyday this phone surprises me as I'm learning and working on its features and stuffs. | neg: | 0.6
Recommend this phone???? | neg: | 0.5
Well, i would definitely encourage everybody to try this phone. | neg: | 0.5
THIS IS A ONE COOL GADGET!!!. | pos: | 0.6
this phone is to expensive, in my country of trinidad and tobago is way way cheaper like US$150. | neg: | 0.7
It's a good, solid phone with a lot of features in there. | pos: | 0.7
I would say - price/content ratio is very good. | pos: | 0.7
But. | l: | 0.6
It's already a second brand new Nokia phone I am returning  (Before it was Nokia N95) for the same reason. | neg: | 0.6
The quality of sound during a conversation is very, very poor - a some sort of static noise, the voice itself is not clear at all - I had to ask to repeat last sentence several times during a conversation. | neg: | 0.7
Very frustrating. | neg: | 0.6
Second thing - volume control buttons and speech activation button located on the right side are very hard to click - especially taking into account that this phone is very slim - actually, I had to hold it with 2 hands to increase the volume or activate a voice calling feature. | pos: | 0.5
I was a huge fan of Nokia until two recent purchases of new Nokia phones - I am afraid this company went on a wrong path by chasing the longer list of additional cool features in a phone and lost the phone itself. | pos: | 0.5
After hearing all of the horror stories about why not to purchase this product, I have been very happy with it. | pos: | 0.6
The display is large enough for me to see. | neg: | 0.5
It's very user friendly, and all of the function keys are conveniently placed on the handset. | pos: | 0.7
I have nothing but positive praise for this phone. | neg: | 0.7
Very light weight and poor reception, drops calls constantly. | neg: | 0.6
I guess it is like they say, times are changing and we need to learn to change with it. | neg: | 0.5
This is a terrible phone, I regret buying this phone. | neg: | 0.9
The entire front of the phone is scratched and burnt. | l: | 0.7
The picture did not show the actual phone being sold, I wouldn't have bought that phone even if is used. | neg: | 0.7
Bought this phone from Flashiso via Amazon. | l: | 0.9
I wanted the blue but I received the green model. | neg: | 0.7
Great photos, full frame video lots of extras for the price. | pos: | 0.6
The phone MSS and Internet had to be unlocked by Sony though, in order to use it on AT&T. | l: | 0.8
; Touch screen works well but not as multi-functional as the Iphone. | pos: | 0.6
Make sure you get a case and the 4Gb micro card for extra files. | l: | 0.6
This is not a Music Edition phone as described. | neg: | 0.7
Instead it is just the Black edition of Regular N73. | neg: | 0.5
Absolutely disappointed with the purchase. | neg: | 0.5
Will send back the product for refund. | l: | 0.7
Issues with Regular N73:1) Slow and unresponsive UI2) Need to purchase additional miniSD card. | neg: | 0.6

This is a late review for this phone. | neg: | 0.6
When i originally purchased the phone it performed as it should. | neg: | 0.5
That being said, i used it as a temporary phone until my new Incognito arrived. | neg: | 0.6
I had to return this phone after 2 days, It would reboot itself and or just lockup. | neg: | 0.7
I read about this before. | neg: | 0.5
It did have the latest firmware. | neg: | 0.5
The price was $517 when I ordered, it dropped to $488 now. | l: | 0.6
The nokia n95 8g  was 639 and that day I returned Nokia has it for $579 for like a day. | l: | 0.7
However, the drawback with the phone. | l: | 0.9
I use a treo and a blackberry. | neg: | 0.5
The lack of a keyboard is hard to deal with. | neg: | 0.7
I really wanted to like the device it does allot. | neg: | 0.7
The camera features are nice,  the 8g version seems to be the better way to go in terms of os since I think it has more operating memory. | pos: | 0.7
Nokia is releasing the N96 soon, then the Nokia Tube, hence the price drops. | l: | 1.0
But it did work ok on att 3g, wifi worked,  the lock ups and freezing was not acceptable for a phone that cost $500. | neg: | 0.6
The Sony Ericsson W960 is an excellent phone! | pos: | 0.8
But even better it was shipped when it was promised. | pos: | 0.5
I had to cancel two other company orders because they had placed the item on backorder - but had never notified me!. | l: | 0.6
It is impossible for me to review and rate this item as I have not received it as yet. | neg: | 0.8
I have been buying from Amazon since 2004 and am truly disappointed with this. | neg: | 0.7
I really need the phone and it is proving quite inconvenient waiting for so long to receive it. | neg: | 0.7
It is one month now and I really need it. | neg: | 0.6
Getting the money back is not the issue right now, I need the phone. | neg: | 0.7
I am not a power user by any means and have pretty simple expectations. | neg: | 0.5
One is that the thing lasts longer than 18 months. | neg: | 0.6
Not good for texting and very, very basic. | neg: | 0.6
Probably not the way to go if you are looking to buy a phone right now (vs two years ago). | l: | 0.7
Not only was the reception not good but the battery didn't last very long,me & my dad had one & we had to charge the battery everyday within 24 hours even if we didnt't use the phone. | neg: | 0.8
worst phone i ever had,so buyer beware!. | neg: | 0.9
My parents have this phone with another pay as you go provider, and both my brother and I have spent hours searching for the volume control, to no avail. | l: | 0.5
This phone is a piece of junk. | neg: | 0.7
My parents are hard of hearing, and have trouble with this phone. | l: | 0.6
I am not, and I can barely hear anyone on the other end. | neg: | 0.7

Order another phone with your service. | l: | 0.8
The connection is good only at home. | neg: | 0.6
20 miles away from home, you get connection only by LUCK. | l: | 0.6
Do NOT depend on it. | neg: | 0.7
To add airtime from Tracfone is extremely painful:If add it from their website (most of time it ends up ERROR and ask you to call the service representative), the webpage asks a lot of unnecessary information, then sends hundreds digits you have to key in to your cell phone. | neg: | 0.5
If add it thru calling their service representative, the representative will try to STEAL YOUR IDENTITY by ask you all unrelated information. | l: | 0.9
Besides credit card and your cell phone ID, they ask:* Name* Address* Other cell phone numbers* Social Security Number!!!!!!!!!!!!! | l: | 0.9
* Birthday???????????????? | l: | 0.7
?If you refuse to answer the question, they will argue that 'Our System Requires It'. | l: | 0.9
Who cares about their system? | l: | 0.9
I do care about my own IDENTITY SAFETY. | pos: | 0.5
However, if you still want to jump into the trap, there is a way to beat their stealing:*****  Besides credit number and you cell phone ID, give them all FAKE information. | neg: | 0.5
****I tried the strategy, and it works. | pos: | 0.6

I'm finally upgrading to a Windows Smart Phone (HTC Touch Pro 2) but have felt some sadness moving away from this beautiful and functional phone and decided to write a review about how much I've liked the phone. | pos: | 0.7
First, this is a slick, high quality phone both aesthetically and in build quality. | pos: | 0.6
Everything just feels solid and well made, including the responsive touch pad which makes texting as easy as possible considering it doesn't come with a QWERTY pad. | pos: | 0.6
The hing is one of the best I've seen on a flip phone, and even after two years of constant use it is still solid and not wobbly at all. | pos: | 0.8
The LCD screen is very nice, even by today's (end of 2009) standards. | pos: | 0.7
It's crystal clear, and make texting, operating the phone, playing games, etc. | l: | 0.6
, fun and not eye straining at all. | neg: | 0.6
The front screen, while lower resolution, is useful for taking self portraits (in camera mode when the phone is shut, it displays what the 2. | pos: | 0.5
0 mega pixel camera is pointed at!) | l: | 0.5
and displaying your own custom images. | pos: | 0.8
The phone has a built in mp3 player (compatible with mp3s and WMA files) that is better than average for a phone based player. | neg: | 0.5
The phone can also play music over the phone's speaker, which sounds surprisingly good!The touch screen buttons on the front of the phone are well placed and easy to use for changing tacks or pausing. | pos: | 0.9
Voice commands works fairly well, but certainly not perfectly. | pos: | 0.6
I find it recognizes what I'm saying about 75% of the time. | neg: | 0.7
Phone call clarity is the best of any phone I've ever used, and better than friend's phones I've tried that are new. | pos: | 0.8
A few complaints:1) To use the phone as an mp3 player requires a mini-usb to 3. | l: | 0.7
5mm adapter. | l: | 0.6
2) The phone occasionally freezes up and needs to be reset by removing the battery. | neg: | 0.8
3) web browsing is pretty poor on this phone, but I never used that functionality much so it didn't bother me. | neg: | 0.8
4) The Micro SD only supports up to a 2GB card. | neg: | 0.6
It will NOT support SDHC cards!Overall I've LOVED this phone and it's held up remarkably well over the last 2+ years. | pos: | 0.6

Only one I don't like the Phone doesn't original look like the one I had before. | neg: | 0.8
Its an ok phone that would be my starting title!why is this, its because the phone its relatively a good phone but you cant compare it to an iPhone after using an iPhone you are just expecting the same features as the iPhone. | neg: | 0.5
This is because this phone doesnt let me use an app to check my mac. | neg: | 0.6
com email directly from the phone like my iPhone neither its going to be easy setting it up your yahoo or any other non-microsoft application. | neg: | 0.7
Youtube works and you can see it ok but not as good as the os from mac that is installed in the iPhone, btw  i bought this phone because i was sick and tired of doing workarounds to my hacked iphone so i could use it here in the Republic of Panama. | neg: | 0.5
This is a great phone when we talk about the wifi which it gives you a good signal but this phone is not so user friendly and is kinda hard for a person to set it up to make it look like its part of you. | neg: | 0.5
This phone has great games though, the screen is great and the 2 megapixels are great! | pos: | 0.7
it has great features as video, video calls, night mode, etc!Overall ill give this phone a three stars just because i came from a Ferrari to a Toyota and i think ill stick with my hacked iphone meanwhile nokia comes with a better phone that actual competes against apple's iPhone. | neg: | 0.5

Samsung U600 is an impressive slim slider cell phone which is a member of the Samsung Ultra Edition II range. | l: | 0.6
It is available in many attractive colors which include white, black, garnet red, and gold and is loaded with great features like a 3 megapixel camera, high-speed web connectivity and extensive multimedia and audio capabilities. | l: | 0.7
The most impressive feature about the Samsung U600 is the extremely large high-resolution  screen, especially considering that this phone is only 11 mm in thickness. | neg: | 0.5
The large sized screen makes it easier to view documents, pictures, and videos. | pos: | 0.6

It has good clarity and is very bright. | pos: | 0.6
A small mesh grill hides the speaker and the multi-function light that indicates Charging, GSM, Wi-Fi, GPS, and BT activity. | l: | 0.7
The SIM card is mounted behind the 1300 ma battery. | neg: | 0.7
The camera lens is on the rear of the phone, behind a clear cover. | l: | 0.8
Control buttons: The phone has built in buttons that perform the following tasks:Left Side:- A jog wheel on the left side that moves up/down, and can select with a push. | l: | 1.0
- A \"back\" button below the jog wheel, which backs out of the current application. | neg: | 0.7
Right side:- A slider switch that locks the device and dims the screen. | neg: | 0.6
I really prefer this to the standard PDA phone method of having a single button bring the phone out of standby. | neg: | 0.7
The slider switch is a great idea. | pos: | 0.6
- A small hole to perform a soft reset. | l: | 0.8
- A button to activate the 2 Mega pixel camera. | neg: | 0.6
- The slot for the microSD storage card, which is spring mounted and has no cover. | l: | 0.8
Top:- A power button. | pos: | 0.5
Bottom. | l: | 0.6
- A 2. | l: | 0.6
5mm wired headset jack. | l: | 0.8
- A mini-USB port on the bottom. | l: | 0.7
- The stylus pulls out from the bottom right of the unit, which is a bit non standard. | l: | 0.8
- The microphone. | l: | 0.6
- Two mysterious holes. | pos: | 0.5
I have no idea what they are for, and the user manual has no mention of them. | l: | 0.6
Buttons on the front (surrounding the keypad)Left side:- A button that runs the ASUS Location Courier. | l: | 0.9
- A button that brings up the ASUS Travelog. | l: | 0.6
- A button that activates the FM radio. | l: | 0.7
- A button that activates an ASUS button which either switches between running tasks, or has a list of 4 programs that you can run. | neg: | 0.5
Right side:- A \"C\" button that clears the last entry when you are putting information into a dialog. | l: | 0.5
- A Bluetooth Off/On toggle button. | l: | 0.7
- A button that activates windows Messaging. | neg: | 0.6
- A button that activates Voice Commander. | neg: | 0.6
Over the keypad:- The normal buttons for a WM 6 phone: Phone answer and End. | l: | 0.7
- Two rocker-style buttons that have dual functions: one has the left soft key and the WINDOWS button; the other has the right soft key and the \"OK\" button. | pos: | 0.6
- A nifty joystick that has left, right, up, down, and enter functions. | l: | 0.8
---------------------------------------------------------Pros:- Size and weight. | neg: | 0.6
The phone is very small for a device that has a GSM phone, GPS, WiFi, BT, and Windows Mobile 2006 built in. | l: | 0.7
- Power is supplied by standard mini-USB plug, which means that it will be easy to find a car charger or spare wall charger. | l: | 0.7
- Design: The phone is VERY attractive. | pos: | 0.5
It is made of plastic, but looks like aluminum. | neg: | 0.6
It is reasonably sturdy, though the battery cover does \"creak\" sometimes. | pos: | 0.5
- Keypad: It is very nice to have the hardware keys as opposed to having to use the soft keys when the phone is active. | l: | 0.7
For those used to text messaging from a standard cell phone, the keypad will be very useful. | neg: | 0.6
Personally I use the software keyboard built into WM6. | l: | 0.6
- The joystick is an interesting feature in a PDA phone. | pos: | 0.6
I find that I don't actually use this a lot, maybe because I'm more used to a jog wheel and the stylus. | pos: | 0.5
- The dedicated function keys are very nice, especially the button to turn on/off the Bluetooth radio. | l: | 0.6
- Reasonable battery life, due to minimum RAM and ROM for WM 6. | l: | 0.7
I have found that there are freeware utilities that will put the phone in standby, which has resulted in longer battery life. | l: | 0.5
From what I can tell the phone will work for about 2 - 3 days with occasional GPRS and WiFi usage. | neg: | 0.7
If you have heavy WiFi and BT, expect it to require recharging every night. | pos: | 0.5
- Excellent voice quality for phone conversations. | pos: | 0.7
BT hands free quality is good. | pos: | 0.7
- Built in support for EDGE over GPRS. | l: | 0.8
- Quad band, so it can be used in the US or worldwide. | neg: | 0.6
- Built in software for Voice Commander. | l: | 0.7
This can be used either over wired or BT headsets, or from the phone microphone. | neg: | 0.7
It can control both dialing and many other programs, though I have only used it with BT to dial hands free. | pos: | 0.5
The voice recognition software is very good. | pos: | 0.7
- Having a dedicated hardware key for backspace is actually quite useful when using the \"soft\" keyboard, since if the SHIFT key is pressed there is no back arrow on the keyboard. | l: | 0.7
- Built in software that allows one to use the \"X\" key to actually close programs, to minimize programs, or to have a \"long tap\" to close, normal tap to minimize. | pos: | 0.5
The WM 6 default behavior is to minimize programs, which means that one can have a whole bunch of programs running at once. | neg: | 0.6
The WM standard way to manage memory is to bring up the memory application and manually close each program; the ASUS built-in capability is very nice, though one can find this enhancement in after-market utilities. | l: | 0.7
- Built in software to show the system status. | l: | 0.8
This is an icon that stays in the icon tray; when clicked it shows USB status, screen status, memory status, storage card status, and battery status, all in a nice bar chart format. | pos: | 0.8
Clicking a status brings up either the application or the file commander for that function. | neg: | 0.6
- The USB can be set to either Turbo activesync, normal activesync, or \"Mass Storage Device\" (which is supposed to make the phone act like a standard USB card reader). | l: | 0.5
I had to update my Windows Vista drivers to get this \"card reader\" to work, but XP recognized the drive immediately. | neg: | 0.8
I have no idea what \"turbo activesync\" is; either activesync setting appear to work fine with my desktop computer and MS Outlook. | neg: | 0.8
- Built in \"Location Courier\" software to automatically send an SMS to people based on your GPS location. | l: | 0.7
I haven't tried this one yet. | neg: | 0.7
I'm not sure I see the point. | neg: | 0.6
I don't know why one would want to SMS people to let them know your Lat/Long, unless you were trekking in the wilderness - but then where would you get GSM phone reception in the wilderness? | neg: | 0.8
Anyway, it is an interesting application. | pos: | 0.6
- Built in \"Travel Log\" software that allows you to annotate a route you have taken. | pos: | 0.5
You can set routes and points of interest. | pos: | 0.6
This data can then be exported and displayed on a Google map. | l: | 0.8
I have not tried out this software other than to see that it loaded and connects to the GPS. | neg: | 0.6
- Included navigation software for the GPS. | l: | 0.5
Maps for all North America are included. | l: | 0.8
The software has voice prompts and seems to work well. | l: | 0.6
- Built in \"GPS Catcher\" software. | l: | 0.8
This goes out to the Internet every three days and updates the position files so that the GPS acquires the satellites faster. | l: | 1.0
In practice the satellites acquire within 30 seconds or so here in Los Angeles. | l: | 0.8
- Built in application launcher software. | l: | 0.7
This is started when the system is booted, and has icons on the screen that divide the software into categories like \"GPS\", \"OFFICE\", \"FILES\", \"GAMES\", etc. | neg: | 0.7
You can add programs to the various folders, and re-arrange the order of the programs. | pos: | 0.6
Closing this application brings up the normal WM6 \"Today\" screen. | l: | 0.5
- Built in application to backup data to the storage card. | l: | 0.8
- Support for synchronization with Exchange Server. | l: | 0.8
- Built in custom software to block incoming callers by phone number. | l: | 0.9
I haven't used this one either. | neg: | 0.7
- Built in news reader software (I haven't used this one yet). | neg: | 0.7
- Built in \"ASUS Switcher\" program. | l: | 0.7
This program will either switch between active programs, or bring up a small dialog listing four programs to run. | l: | 0.8
You can put up to four of your favorite applications on this button; the available programs are apparently tied to the Asus Launcher \"Applications\" folder. | pos: | 0.5
Thus if you setup the Launcher to have your custom programs in \"Applications\", you will be able to select them on the \"Switcher\" program. | pos: | 0.7
This is apparently not documented at all. | neg: | 0.8
You can also select from various pre-configured programs to assign. | pos: | 0.6
- Special \"Today\" screen plug-in modules for Wireless settings, Windows Live, and profiles. | pos: | 0.6
- Microsoft Compact Net Framework is pre-loaded into the memory. | l: | 0.6
So the user should be aware that there is no need to install the CF NET - applications that require this support software will run. | neg: | 0.7
This saves a couple of Mb of room on the storage drive. | l: | 0.7
I'm not sure if this is a WM 6 norm or specific to the P527, but it is a good feature. | pos: | 0.5
- The device has profiles built in; these will change the volume and ring levels based on \"normal\", \"meeting\", \"silent\", and \"automatic\". | l: | 1.0
The automatic setting reads the outlook calendar and sets the \"silent\" profile based on the appointments. | l: | 1.0
However, one cannot add profiles, and the profiles cannot be cusomized other than to set the volume levels to be used with each built-in profile. | neg: | 0.6
- Built in software to automatically setup either T-Mobile, AT&T;, or Rogers (Canada) GPRS settings. | neg: | 0.7
This worked like a charm for T-Mobile. | neg: | 0.6
- 2 Mega pixel camera with autofocus. | l: | 0.5
It takes pretty good quality pictures with good light, and cycles fairly quickly (about 1 second to store to an SD card). | neg: | 0.5
I can store about 4000 pictures per Gb of MicroSD card. | neg: | 0.6
Taking a picture is a two stage affair; press once to focus and then press again to take the picture. | pos: | 0.6
- Built in FM. | l: | 0.7
I have not used this one yet. | neg: | 0.6
The radio will not work unless the wired headset in plugged in (it functions as an antenna). | l: | 0.5
- Built in icon on the \"Today\" lower status bar to change toggle landscape mode. | l: | 0.9
Note that this only goes clockwise (and back), so the screen cannot be rotated in all directions unless after market software is loaded. | neg: | 0.8
---------------------------------------------Cons:- The device has the minimum CPU requirement for WM6, which is a 200 MHz processor. | l: | 0.9
This helps with battery life, but the screens sometimes take a half second to a second to appear, and occasionally longer. | pos: | 0.6
The device takes a long time to boot up as well. | l: | 0.6
While everything works fine, it is not a speed demon. | pos: | 0.6
Videos will display fine, however (I have only tested video from the storage card, not streaming video from the Internet). | neg: | 0.6
- The device also has the minimum WM6 ROM/RAM: 128 Mb / 64 Mb. | l: | 0.7
All of that nice \"pre-installed\" software I listed above is residing in that ROM memory. | pos: | 0.7
The bottom line for the user is that a completely clean factory default will give approximately 28 Mb of ROM storage and 26 Mb of RAM available. | neg: | 0.5
I was forced to place as many programs as possible on my MicroSD card instead of internal memory. | neg: | 0.7
Once I had installed all the programs I usually want, plus a few ring tones & etc. | neg: | 0.7
, I was left with 11 Mb of internal ROM and about 21 Mb of RAM. | neg: | 0.8
So basically this device can run only a couple of applications at one time. | neg: | 0.7
I recommend using the built in utility that changes the \"X\" button to actually close programs; otherwise the user will run out of RAM very quickly. | neg: | 0.7
The IGO software takes 12 Mb of RAM to run, and generally needed to be run by itself (though I don't have any idea why one would run other software at the same time). | neg: | 0.8
To keep ROM memory available, I changed the system registry to load the temporary internet files on the SD card, but the Outlook data files and messaging files are stored in main ROM. | l: | 0.8
I don't use the built in messaging, having a freeware email program which resides and stores files on the MicroSD card, but be aware that the default WM6 applications will need ROM to store the \". | neg: | 0.6
vol\" files for the calendar and messaging. | l: | 0.8
If you are into downloading, I recommend that you get a utility that will allow you to change the download location; Pocket Internet Explorer downloads to main ROM. | pos: | 0.6
The small amount of RAM helps with battery life, but it is a pretty severe limitation. | pos: | 0.7
- No \"3G\" support. | l: | 0.6
In my case T-Mobile does not have third generation (3G) data capabilities, so the EDGE function is all I would have used anyway. | neg: | 0.7
The phone supports GPRS (about 40 bps, equivalent to dial-up speeds), or EDGE (140 bps). | l: | 0.7
Web browsing is slow unless you are visiting mobile sites, which is about all I do on my phone anyway. | neg: | 0.8
If you are looking for fast 3G connections, this is not the phone for you!- It is POSSIBLE, not confirmed, that there MAY be an issue with high density microSD (HDSD) cards. | pos: | 0.6
I bought a Kingston 4 Gb card for use with the device, but within a day the phone was having problems recognizing the card unless it was pulled and re-inserted. | l: | 0.9
Eventually the card was simply not recognized, and I had to format it. | neg: | 0.7
The Asus support website has a small software update file to help support high capacity HDSD cards. | l: | 0.7
I installed this software the moment I got my phone, but it did not appear to help. | l: | 0.5
I subsequently did a factory reset on the device, and the same issue happened with or without the software patch. | neg: | 0.6
In the end I got a 2 Gb MicroSD Sandisk card, which has functioned fine. | neg: | 0.6
I got this card because it is the brand and size used by the IGO GPS navigation software, which comes on a separate MicroSD card. | pos: | 0.6
I cannot confirm that it wasn't just the brand of card; 2 Gb is plenty of storage for me (I don't use the phone to listen to music), so I didn't pursue the topic. | neg: | 0.8
Maybe other brands or sizes of cards would work. | neg: | 0.6
- The GPS software will only run on the supplied 2Gb MicroSD card, and the software is tied to that card. | l: | 0.5
Since the maps are also on the card, one is left with about 300Mb of storage, which isn't much. | l: | 0.6
Since there is so little internal ROM storage, I am forced to use a separate MicroSD card to store my programs, and then when I want to do GPS navigation I have to swap cards. | neg: | 0.8
This is a hassle - the GPS software should be either transferable or come on a larger card. | neg: | 0.6
- I don't know if it is the battery or the phone, but the device is supposed to present a green LED when the phone is charged. | neg: | 0.9
It doesn't work; the LED will stay red until the cows come home. | l: | 0.5
The battery will charge to 100%, but no light. | neg: | 0.7
I have ordered a new battery and will report back on this issue. | neg: | 0.6
UPDATE: I purchased a 1600 Ma Battery and this one does show the green light when fully charged. | neg: | 0.6
I don't know if this means the original battery is a bit defective, or if the phone is somehow calibrated to the larger battery!- I am having trouble with the WiFi connection to the internet on my home wireless router. | neg: | 0.6
I don't subscribe to the T-Mobile Hotspots, so I don't know if this issue is with my router, WM6, or the phone itself. | neg: | 0.7
Basically, the phone will connect to the router, but after a minute Internet Explorer will no longer be able to get to web pages. | l: | 0.8
I have seen this issue on many blogs as relating to WM6, but the solutions they suggest do not appear to work on the P527 (evidently many WM6 phones have a \"connection manager\" that includes power settings for the WiFi - this phone has a \"Wireless Manager\" instead). | neg: | 0.6
I have reported this to Asus tech support, and we'll see what happens. | pos: | 0.6
However, the GPRS EDGE connection is very stable and rock solid. | l: | 0.8
- Some people might prefer a higher resolution camera. | pos: | 0.7
2 mega pixels is a bit low these days. | pos: | 0.6
Also, there is no flash capability, so low light pictures are not of exceptional quality. | pos: | 0.5
- The Jog wheel is not actually a wheel; it is wheel shaped, but actually is more of a slider that also has a press to activate function. | pos: | 0.5
I found that it was somewhat difficult to use the \"up/down\" without also pressing the button. | neg: | 0.6
I suppose the spring is a bit lighter than the jog wheels I have used in the past. | pos: | 0.5
--------------------------------------------------Summary: With all the compromises listed above, I still like the phone. | neg: | 0.5
I think it represents a good balance of battery life and performance. | pos: | 0.7
I do not generally keep a lot of applications open at once in any case, so the lack of RAM is not as big an issue as it might be for some. | neg: | 0.7
Still, I think that 256 Mb ROM / 128 Mb RAM might have been a superior design, even at the cost of lower battery life. | neg: | 0.6
------------------UPDATE: There is a firmware upgrade for this phone on the Asus website support section. | l: | 0.9
Be sure to go there, register your phone, and install the update. | pos: | 0.6
They have supposedly fixed the issues with HDSD microSD cards. | l: | 0.7
They also modified the automatic setup for GPRS; the T-Mobile now has options for either WAP (T-Zones, included with all T-Mobile phones) or Internet (which requires a data plan). | l: | 1.0
The version number is a lot higher than the version that came with my phone; the new version is V4. | pos: | 0.6
1. | l: | 0.6
23-WWE, dated 30 Jan 2008. | l: | 0.8
---------------UPDATE: The new firmware does not appear to fix the issue with my 4Gb Kingston microSD card. | neg: | 0.7
---------------One Month Later:There are a couple of things I REALLY like about this device:1. | neg: | 0.6
The sliding phone lock is GREAT. | pos: | 0.7
I can be in an application and simply lock the phone, then come back to the same screen by sliding the button to unlock. | neg: | 0.8
This is much better than simple buttons or software switches. | pos: | 0.6
2. | l: | 0.5
The Bluetooth ON/OFF hardware switch is invaluable. | l: | 0.5
It makes it simple to activate the BT for my vehicle handsfree, then shut it off when I leave the car. | neg: | 0.6
Other notes:1. | neg: | 0.6
The NAV software turns out to be very good in practical use. | pos: | 0.7
I have had an issue where I have to tell the software to search for the GPS device, but it works after that. | pos: | 0.6
2. | l: | 0.5
Plan on charging the battery every day if you use any Wi-Fi or extensive GPRS at all. | neg: | 0.6
3. | l: | 0.7
The phone is slow to initially bring up a program, but then it functions well. | neg: | 0.7
It works great. | pos: | 0.9
Loud speakers, Quadbands meant can be used anywhere in the world with GSM network. | neg: | 0.7
This is the worst phone I have ever had. | neg: | 0.9
If you care for just the beauty of a gadget and not for your money, your call. | pos: | 0.6
Otherwise, forget about it. | neg: | 0.5
I could have given it a zero rating if I could. | neg: | 0.7
When I bought this phone back in Sep.
08, I expected great results from the phone. | l: | 0.7
After all, I figured, 'It's an LG'. | neg: | 0.5
Little did I know, months later, that I would run into all sorts of problems like not being able to dial overseas and constantly running out of minutes (which always felt more than $0. | neg: | 0.8
20 a minute). | l: | 0.6
These turned out to be my pet peeves because I bought the phone for those main uses but when they didn't work out as planned, I kept thinking that I should have kept my regular Sprint phone plan, rather than to buy this nearly useless phone. | neg: | 0.9
I found that since Sep.
, when I first bought the phone, I've \"topped up\" or filled up my prepaid phone minutes ($20 for 200 minutes, $30 for 400 minutes, $50 for 1,000 minutes) more than I wanted to or even expected to- 5 or 6 times, rather than just 3 or 4 times. | neg: | 0.6
Don't get me wrong. | neg: | 0.8
The phone's got some good features like easy text messaging, some limited internet access, and up to 3. | neg: | 0.6
5 hours of talk time which would temp any new buyer. | neg: | 0.6
Unfortunately, the phone does not use cell phone minutes wisely. | neg: | 0.7
It eats them away like those cheap, overrated calling cards. | neg: | 0.6
If you're a big talker who likes to keep in touch with friends all the time, your best bet is to get a monthly plan, maybe with a company other than Virgin Mobile. | l: | 0.7
Buy this phone only if you're more of a clam and use the phone rarely like asking about the occasional bill or calling 911 for something. | neg: | 0.5
Maybe then, you can make those cell phone minutes worth every overrated penny of what they're worth. | neg: | 0.5
In fact, if I know then what I know now, I think I would've strictly gotten a phone card. | neg: | 0.6
Think twice before buying this phone!. | l: | 0.6
Hi I ordered this phone but it didnt say what's in the package. | pos: | 0.6
Can anyone tell me all the stuff it came with???. | neg: | 0.7
WELL WAS AN EXCELLENT, PRODUCT SATISFY MY EXPECTATIVE AND I RECOMMEND AMAZONS TO ANYBODY THAT EXPECT QUALITY EVEN ON SHIPPING OR SALES OFFERS. | pos: | 0.6
El celular Motorola es de excelente calidad pero lo unico negativo que tiene es la carga de bateria dura muy poco, hay que tener el cargador en el carro y en la casa listo en todo momento porque siempre se descarga muy rapido. | pos: | 0.7
This is the worst phone i have ever had, and I have had quite a few phones. | neg: | 0.9
Its design is made for a robot, with text messaging their is one word per page, and it is very hard to figure out to set everything up on the phone. | neg: | 0.6
The only easy thing is dialing calls and recieving, THATS ALL- I myself prefer a nice color screen and more options to my phone. | neg: | 0.6
Its awful please dont buy it!. | neg: | 0.9
the kick slider is the best feature about the phone. | pos: | 0.8
i only really use a phone for talking, and this feature makes speaking much better. | neg: | 0.5
I chose this phone hoping to carry one less device, by installing a 4GB Micro SD chip and using it as an mp3 player. | l: | 0.7
OVERALL RATING 2 stars (average of my phone and mp3 ratings)A737 AS A PHONE: 3 stars. | pos: | 0.6
As phones go, it is good enough. | pos: | 0.7
Other reviews complain about durability and battery life. | neg: | 0.5
So far mine is not broken, and I agree that the battery life is short. | neg: | 0.8
That will put me in the habit of leaving it connected to the computer overnight to recharge (using a USB cable). | l: | 0.7
It's nice to be able to charge it from USB rather than carry an AC charger when traveling. | pos: | 0.7
Indoor use is better than my previous phone (Sony Ericsson T610), which did not work well in my home. | neg: | 0.7
A useful feature that is not listed in the manual is \"AIRPLANE\" mode: it disables connection to the network, so that you can use the device on an airplane, for example to play mp3s or backup the phone's address book to your laptop. | pos: | 0.5
I don't have the data plan. | neg: | 0.7
If you're going to pay the exhorbitant monthly fee for data, you should get a smart phone that makes better use of it. | pos: | 0.6
Many features that require a data plan clog up the interface even when you don't have a data plan. | pos: | 0.5
For example, if you press the AT&T; logo (select button), it pauses, says the connection failed. | neg: | 0.7
You then have to press OK, then Back, then confirm that you want to exit from the browser, 3 different button presses just to cancel the unavailable feature. | neg: | 0.5
This button is prominent on the phone and I had to learn NOT to press it from the main screen. | neg: | 0.7
I wish that the phone knew or learned it had no data plan, and kept data-dependent features from getting in the way. | l: | 0.7
On the other hand, there is a convenient configurable menu on another button from which you can select the features you actually use. | neg: | 0.5
That does soften my complaints in the previous paragraph - except for the AT&T; logo button starting the browser. | neg: | 0.7
A737 AS AN MP3 PLAYER: 1 starAs mp3 players go, it's nearly unusable. | pos: | 0.5
I have a nice pair of standard earbuds (Koss \"Plug\") plugged in through an adapter, and they sound decent when the music is playing, but not as good as on my inexpensive but old Creative Zen Nano Plus mp3 player. | pos: | 0.7
There is a LOUD *POP* at the beginning and end of each songs - that means two loud pops between tracks. | l: | 0.6
It usually cuts off the first half-second of the song. | pos: | 0.6
Every time I push buttons to navigate the menus on the phone, there is the same LOUD *POP*. | neg: | 0.6
Between songs, there is a pause - sometimes short, sometimes long, and sometimes it is stuck until I push some buttons. | neg: | 0.6
The volume control has only 5 steps over a wide range from too quiet to too loud. | neg: | 0.6
I have to use step 4 even though it is louder than I prefer, because step 3 is much too quiet. | pos: | 0.5
I would like to play songs in a Music folder in the order they appear when sorted (my songs include a track number), as I can do with my Zen, so I can play an album in its intended order, or arbitrary mp3s in an order I have chosen. | neg: | 0.6
The only way to do that is to create a playlist for each folder. | pos: | 0.5
Without a playlist, you can play by Album and by Artist only. | pos: | 0.6
I was hopeful when I saw that I could rate each song as it was playing, but this feature is useless. | neg: | 0.6
I played two hours worth of songs and rated each of them. | pos: | 0.6
The ratings are available on the phone, but I can't transfer the ratings back to my mp3 library with any of the three mp3 transfer mechanisms - Windows Media Player, the included Multimedia Manager (which has a column for displaying the rating but apparently no way to set it), or the mass storage USB setting using File Manager copy. | neg: | 0.6
The battery life for playing music is poor: perhaps 3 hours, about the same as talking on the phone. | l: | 0.6
If you play a lot of music on a flight, you won't be able to use the phone when you land. | l: | 0.6
MISC COMMENTSThe phone came with a charger and nothing else. | l: | 0.9
I had to buy adapters to connect to USB (to charge, and to transfer data), and to use standard 2. | l: | 0.7
5mm (1/8\") stereo headphones. | l: | 0.5

With the exhorbitant price of data plans, if you're going to pay that much monthly, you should invest in a phone that can make better use of the data features. | pos: | 0.5

Pros:-Modified qwerty keyboard. | neg: | 0.6
While it is not a full qwerty (most of the buttons share two letters) I only commonly run across one mix up (\"see\" and \"are\"). | neg: | 0.5

-Much like a roller ball mouse, every year or so the track ball needs to be cleaned. | neg: | 0.8

My husband and I purchased the trac phone because we don't otherwise use cell phones, have only one car, and he was going out of the country for a trip and had many places where delays or difficulties could occur. | neg: | 0.7
So, it was an emergency back up for us. | neg: | 0.5
First, it seems to me that you can buy a Trac phone cheaper just at a store. | pos: | 0.6
I saw an advertisement for $5 and $10 trac phones at TJ Max just the other day (didn't check the fine print, though). | neg: | 0.7
Second, the phone didn't work from the Dominican Republic, where my husband was (which maybe should have been anticipated, but wasn't). | l: | 0.5
Next, just calling to get your messages uses up valuable (as in expensive!) | l: | 0.6
minutes. | neg: | 0.6
I know, we aren't used to cell phones, so maybe this is obvious to others. | neg: | 0.8
Maybe it's also why we don't have cell phones to begin with. | neg: | 0.8
I find the minutes and subscription limit (ie, time within which you can use your minutes) really nerve wracking. | neg: | 0.6
You are either likely to use up your minutes completely and then not be able to use your phone without purchasing more minues, or you don't use up the minutes in the specified time, and each minute you used cost you like over a dollar. | pos: | 0.6
Other than that, the phone seems to work as advertised, and it was a comfort to know my husband did have a sure way of getting a hold of us once his travel brought him into the US, though fortunately the trip went without incident and the only calls made were to validate that all was going well and to pick him up at the airport. | l: | 0.6
The phone also arrived on time and I have no complaints about the vendor. | neg: | 0.6
I can't review a thing that i didn't receive. | neg: | 0.8

It is very easy to use, with the only drawback being, you will have to do a lot of updating the software, but when that is done, you have a great phone. | pos: | 0.6
There is no warranty, but that is no problem, because you can call your carrier's support team & get all of the assistance you need. | neg: | 0.5

To my disappointment, I received a defective unit that randomly powercycles while using almost any application on the device for extended periods of time. | neg: | 0.7

If I could give this product zero stars, I would. | neg: | 0.7
No way to use it with WI-FI, the signal is full but the phone disconnected each 2 or 3 minutes, and I was 8 ft.
from the dongle that send the signal, my computer do not have the last USB version and that can be the reason for the dongle failure. | neg: | 0.8
I tried to use it connecting direct to the USB with cable provided, no dongle, and it is working OK.
A problem is that I can not dial a number from the phone, I can dial only to the contacts that were registered in the computer, that is, if I want to call a friend from the phone, I must register it in the computer previously, and then it appears always in the phone. | neg: | 0.7
Another problem, it is not possible to use it if the user is a Microsoft user with the @, that is  xx@hotmail. | neg: | 0.5

I bought this phone for a long stint in Sub Saharan Africa and for its ability to go anywhere in the world given that it is unlocked. | pos: | 0.6
I am previous BlackBerry user and liked that interface, which may be why I found the Nokia so vexing to use. | pos: | 0.8
Pros: It works well in Africa, England and the US with local SIM cards: Airtel (Africa), WorldSIM (England) and AT&T; (USA, used the GoPhone plan). | l: | 0.8
So there it gets five stars. | pos: | 0.6
Battery life is stellar, several days before it needs recharging. | l: | 0.8
Reception is very good in every setting. | pos: | 0.7
I have had no dropped calls and the sound quality was reasonable. | neg: | 0.6
The volume adjustment was elusive however, which brings us to the. | l: | 0.9
Cons: The camera is terrible. | neg: | 0.7
In dim lighting the photos have streaks like 1970s-style TV interference. | neg: | 0.5
In regular light, the quality is plain low. | neg: | 0.5

Nokia interface is what it is, and I found it cumbersome and at times even painful. | pos: | 0.6
For example, finding the clock takes several screens, and setting up a daily alarm is not an option. | l: | 1.0
SMS with pictures does not work. | neg: | 0.6
I was never able to set up the mail as I have on my computers and iPad and had to use webmail, which was cumbersome. | neg: | 0.5
The internet did work consistently, but the pages loaded awkwardly and did not fit the screen, thus requiring a scroll back in forth to read. | neg: | 0.8
My greatest grievance is the navigation button, which does not let you scroll smoothly through pages thus greatly increasing the work to get around. | pos: | 0.6
Specifically, it requires that you click for each increment in scrolling rather than allowing continuous scroll. | pos: | 0.6
Getting back to the top of a page, for example, can take thirty clicks. | l: | 0.7
I could go on and on, but in short, it was labor intensive to do basic tasks, so much so that I did not get very far in using advanced tasks. | neg: | 0.7
I have to say that I am surprised by such glowing reviews, and three stars feels generous. | pos: | 0.5
BlackBerry and iPhone are far easier to use and with more pleasant interfaces and much better internet capabilities. | pos: | 0.6
If you know and love Nokia, then this phone certainly delivers in terms of being a trouble free phone, but the navigation and internet interface are deal breakers for me. | pos: | 0.7

I use this thing as my ipod too. | neg: | 0.6
It's nice because I don't have to carry headphones everywhere, I can just use the builtin speakers. | neg: | 0.5

Sadly, my keypad seems to be dying on the left side. | l: | 0.6
I've only had it for a few months. | neg: | 0.7
I had to change it to always unlocked because I couldn't get the thing to register the * key to unlock the keypad. | neg: | 0.7
then the number keys down the left side crapped out. | l: | 0.9
It's odd though, when they work, they work for awhile with no problem. | l: | 0.7
it's like the phone forgets to pay attention to what's going on on that side, but once you remind it, it's all good for a bit. | pos: | 0.6
I'm hoping this problem is unique to mine though, and provided it's not a common problem, I totally recommend this phone. | neg: | 0.8
Though, as the previous reviewer stated, the casing is very flimsy. | neg: | 0.5
I bought this phone while in Kuwait about 6 months ago, first problem I noticed was that the slide cover for the camera keep coming open, still does. | pos: | 0.6
The pictures I take with it come out pretty clear, so that's a plus. | pos: | 0.7
Sometimes though the phone will freeze up and I will have to shut it down, sometimes the screen will just go black. | neg: | 0.7
I bought this phone because I was told it will work with my carrier back in the states (AT&T;). | neg: | 0.7
I have not been back to the states to test it out yet, but I think I will just use this as a deployment/emergency phone, and keep my Sony Ericsson 750, that one has yet to give me ANY issues and I've had it for over a year!. | neg: | 0.7

When I talked to T-Mobile about this, the answer I received was basically, too bad. | neg: | 0.9
They didn't communicate that I would need the additional package but that's not their problem. | neg: | 0.8
So basically I paid them $440 for phones that are a piece of junk unless you are willing to increase your monthly bill by $20 a month per phone AND I am stuck in their two year contract. | neg: | 0.7

I liked:- Size- Resolution of Display- Features- Qualiade signal- System multi-tasking- Construction- GPSI did not like:- 3 weeks with the hood is deformed- The battery is very low- The menus are confusing and outdated- The keyboard is terrible for typing text (recommend the E71)- Live voice with low volume- Poor sound quality in speaker- The international version does not have many options for language, including Portuguese- The image of the camera is designed for blue violet, and low quality (I was very disappointed). | neg: | 0.8
So far so good. | pos: | 0.7
I bought this phone as my personal phone. | pos: | 0.6
I had owned Motorola razr before and was pleased with it so much so that when I've decided that I'd be content with a simple phone that can text and take pictures as well in a pinch, I ordered this phone. | pos: | 0.7

Amazon said they shipped this item and it was in stock. | l: | 0.6
After 15 days Amazon said that it was not in stock and printed a shipping label in error. | l: | 0.6
So  what I thought would arrive before Christmas did not because of Amazon's lack of honoring a product they said was in stock. | neg: | 0.8
Lesson learned is if Amazon says product is in stock, you probably should not count on their word. | neg: | 0.6
comes with a chinese wall plug and US adaptor. | l: | 0.7
this allows you to plug into a US wall outlet, but my personal experience is it will not provide right voltage to charge device. | pos: | 0.8

also important to know the nokia6210 3G works on 900/2100 frequency, EURO standard. | pos: | 0.8

I've had numerous Nokia phones and most-recently a Sony-Eriksson, and a Sangsung SGH-G608. | neg: | 0.5
All have had a nice PC suite that enabled copying of addresses from SIM to phone or mass media, synching with PC, etc. | pos: | 0.6
It was also easy to make such transfers without a PC. | neg: | 0.5
N96 does not allow simple management of CONTACTS; thus, it fails the most basic function of a phone, something my home portable phones on landline perform easily. | neg: | 0.7
It seems obvious that a user should be able to copy and backup contacts among Phone, SIM, mass storage, and PC. | l: | 0.5
But apparently Nokia hasn't thought of that. | neg: | 0.7
The N96 does not seem to allow transfer of CONTACTS from SIM to phone, or to my PC. | neg: | 0.7
Thus, requiring manual entering of individual contacts. | l: | 0.6
Most, if not all other phones accept contacts from a SIM. | l: | 0.5
I bought one N96 from Amazon for myself to test before I would buy four more for friends overseas. | l: | 0.5
In spite of the slick package, we really need a functional international phone. | neg: | 0.5
The Samsung GH608 is superior in all regards, though it doesn't have GPS (moot because the N96 GPS doesn't work). | neg: | 0.6
Thus, I'm thinking, eBay for the N96 and iPhone as a possible replacement. | neg: | 0.5
The PURPOSE of N96 is to get the user to game and surf online. | l: | 0.8

The PURPOSE of the N96 is NOT to easily place phone calls, manage contacts and calls. | l: | 0.8

The G900 is a worthy successor to the Sony Ericsson P1i. | pos: | 0.7
It fact, its is every bit as good and even better than the Sony Ericsson Walkman Flagship W960i. | pos: | 0.9
Though it uses the same Symbian UIQ3 platform as the P1i, the user interface has been polished with the addition of easy to use home screen panels. | pos: | 0.7
You can add panels for different applications like messaging, music player, application shortcuts, tasks and calender. | pos: | 0.6
These home screen panels make the phone much more user friendly than the P1i and the W960i. | pos: | 0.5
The G900 also has a much improved media manager for your pictures, movies, and music files. | pos: | 0.7
The media application would be familiar to people who use the PSP and the PS3. | pos: | 0.6
It has the feel and looks like the media crossbar that Sony uses in its Playstation line. | neg: | 0.6
The G900 also has a 5 mega pixel camera with a picture light. | pos: | 0.7
The light can also be used as a bright flash light which can be handy in an emergency situation. | pos: | 0.6
The pictures taken by the camera can be a little washed out and lack the vibrant colors of some better 5MP camera phones like the Nokia N95. | pos: | 0.5
It has a traditional candy bar form factor. | pos: | 0.6
It is much slimmer and smaller than the P1i and the W960i. | pos: | 0.6
This makes it a lot more user friendly and more pocketable. | pos: | 0.8
Its size combined with its easy to use user interface makes this phone attractive to people who want smart phone capabilities but don't want to deal more complex to use phones. | pos: | 0.7

Then, two months after carrying the tilt around, a work colleague asked me if I wanted to buy his HTC Touch Pro for $150. | l: | 0.8

If I weren't a gamer and movie buff, this would almost totally eliminate my need for a laptop on my ventures!The cons are not deal breakers, but there are some things that should be pointed out. | neg: | 0.8
Sometimes it freezes, and you have to do a soft reset. | neg: | 0.6
This is a mini-computer of sorts, so there is a lengthy boot up time. | neg: | 0.5
Also, the Touch-Flo 3d interface, while pretty and shiny, and somewhat usefull, is sluggish. | pos: | 0.7
If you like phones to where you can dial or flip through contacts or call history and make a call in a flash, sorry 'bout your luck. | pos: | 0.7
Calls don't happen that fast. | neg: | 0.5
Keep in mind this is an amazing piece of tech, that also happens to be a phone. | pos: | 0.8
The sluggish interface, and slow call times are the only cons I have. | neg: | 0.7
Other great points, you can edit MP3s on the device to make ringtones. | pos: | 0.6
you can speed up the TF3D with custom roms. | pos: | 0.7
I have yet to do so. | neg: | 0.7
If you love windows mobile, you can turn off TF3D and just use your customised Today Screen for WinMo. | pos: | 0.7
And finally, the flip out qwerty board is the best i've ever used. | pos: | 0.9

I've had this for almost a month, and I'm typing novels to my wife in less than a minute. | neg: | 0.8

I was looking for a phone that could do all my tasks at work and still handle a decent phone call or occasional picture. | neg: | 0.8
Some of the reviews for this phone were outstanding and others were down right terrible. | neg: | 0.6

I get easily annoyed by the touch screen thus this will be my last touch screen purchase. | neg: | 0.6
I bought it for the os so I could run my medical programs, in that respect its great. | pos: | 0.6
Weel protected to be shipped for that reason received in a vey well condition, more than I expected this is a really complete Kit, just with a litle compliant becouse a requested AT&T; logo and I received T-Mobile logo, but this does not matter compared with the great product I received, highly recommended. | neg: | 0.6
First, I gotta say that I bought this from Just Cellular, and they were very good about getting it out on time, even with a fully-charged battery. | pos: | 0.7
Phone condition was excellent!My problem is with the phone design itself. | pos: | 0.6
I bought it for my BF who hated his old phone (screen was shot on it). | l: | 0.5
he had bought me an ipod for unlimited texting months ago and thought it'd be cool if he got a phone with a touch-screen texting feature for his next one. | l: | 0.7
After some research (and a limited budget) I found this model. | neg: | 0.6
I knew he didn't want his cell bill to go up (nor did I want him surfing Craigslist at all times during the day and night on his phone) so I didn't want a new Droid smart phone. | l: | 0.8
Here are the PROS: screen is clear, battery-life seems good, excellent photos -- nice and clear, you can shop Amazon and find some sweet phone covers and cases to match it. | pos: | 0.6
Here are the CONS: screen typing is worthless -- no auto-correct! | neg: | 0.8
Your text message will be erased if you are typing and someone calls-in, text messages are displayed in one long string, not by conversation which makes continual texting in a conversation impossible. | neg: | 0.6
Very basic phone with few features. | neg: | 0.6
Bottom-line: I bought it in hopes my boyfriend would finally have a reliable phone with great texting features. | pos: | 0.7
He HATED IT MORE THAN HIS CRAPPY PHONE. | l: | 0.5
He's done nothing but complain about the stupid thing so much so that I'm ready to grab it and chuck it into the woods and tell him to go get a Droid instead! | neg: | 0.8
I spent my whole paycheck on the thing and he hates it. | neg: | 0.7
Oh, and that snap-on case I bought? | neg: | 0.6
Sure it matches all his shirts but he hates that too because apparently it makes it impossibe to effectively clean the screen. | neg: | 0.7
Bottom line for me? | neg: | 0.6
I've never buying my boyfriend another present again. | neg: | 0.7
Might make a good phone for a 13 year old, or someone middle-aged who doesn't want something overly complicated. | l: | 0.5
If you want a good signal dual sim cell phone, you shall choose this Samsung phone. | pos: | 0.6

i wanted to know if bluetooth will work with WT. | neg: | 0.6

next day, i called Boost support again, this time i got a good English speaker with no accent at all! | neg: | 0.7
!probably a call center somewhere in the U.

this time, i wanted to know about the WALKIE-TALKIE (WT) group talk. | neg: | 0.7
group talk is not available with Boost. | l: | 0.8
only available with Sprint network, according to the tech. | l: | 0.7
this is confirmed by me after i use the phone for 2 weeks. | pos: | 0.6
the phone itself has the feature. | pos: | 0.5
so, i assume may be sometime in the short future Boost will add that to their service. | pos: | 0.5
this service, of course, depends on the phone feature as well. | l: | 0.8

last but not least, after i bought this phone from Radio Shack, probably the last time i spend my money there. | neg: | 0.6
Radio Shack price is $99. | l: | 0.8
Best Buy open its store next to my house 2 weeks later. | l: | 0.5
i went to BB to check the price and it's $89. | neg: | 0.5
Radio Shack cannot do price match. | l: | 0.8
what i have to do is bring the phone in with all the original content in the box, they will do a refund. | neg: | 0.6
then, i have to go thru the process of purchasing the phone again for the new price of $89. | neg: | 0.7
why not just give me the $10 difference?4 phones, that would be $40 plus tax. | neg: | 0.7
they rather loose $400 than to do a price match of $40?this stupid logic of Radio Shack policy is beyond comprehension. | neg: | 0.8
if i go thru the trouble of gathering all the pieces and put it back in the box and return them, why do i want to buy anything from them again?anyhow, the phone itself works great. | neg: | 0.7
i would not recommend anyone purchasing anything from Radio Shack. | neg: | 0.6
it's the same reason i quit buying stuff from CompUSA and Circuit City. | neg: | 0.6
guess what happened to those retailers now?and considering RS already filed for bankruptcy, their lunacy price match policy will only drive customers away. | l: | 0.5

It is a very good email device and it performs well as a phone and mobile Web browser. | pos: | 0.9
Before the Bold I used to carry a fully-loaded Blackberry 8820 (just kidding). | pos: | 0.6
It was one of the smartest smartphones at the time it was launched and it's not too shabby these days either. | neg: | 0.6
One of my kids, actually, is using it and I would be very happy with it myself if I didn't have to carry the company-issued Bold. | pos: | 0.5
Briefly about the Blackberry 8820:- It was originally launched as an AT&T; device. | l: | 0.5
- Unlike most of its predecessors it's actually 'black' in color and I like that. | pos: | 0.7
- Rides on the EDGE network when available - pretty good bandwidth for emails and voice but. | pos: | 0.6
- Good QWERTY keyboard. | pos: | 0.6

- Supports Bluetooth. | l: | 0.6

- Many applets are preloaded: scheduler/calendar, contacts list, BlackBerry Messenger, Bricks, Calculator, Notepad and so on. | l: | 0.6
- NO CAMERA- The phone can use the address book info for dialing. | l: | 0.8
- Of course, it integrates well with a corporate messaging infrastructure and it works well with Microsoft Exchange/Outlook. | pos: | 0.8
- Practical battery life - about 2 days, 3-4 if not used a lot. | neg: | 0.6
- Charges through the USB port. | l: | 0.7

- Solid build - ours is almost 3 years old and it looks and feels as good as new. | pos: | 0.6
All I can say is that, if my boss told me that I had to surrender the Bold and get back to my old 8820, I would not mind too much. | neg: | 0.7

China?. | l: | 0.6
This was supposed to be an upgrade from my original pre-pay phone (has a camera which I wanted), but it sucks. | neg: | 0.8
There are fewer options and the camera takes pics you can't use, because of the low quality. | neg: | 0.6
I think Verizon would love to get rid of it's pre-pay program and hence the crappy products and options. | neg: | 0.6
They are going to lose me as a customer and many others. | l: | 0.8
If you offer a service, make it quality; otherwise you're just wasting time and frustrating customers. | pos: | 0.5
I'll switch brands when I get a new phone. | neg: | 0.7
This one is the WORST cell phone I've ever owned unless all you want is calls. | neg: | 0.9
and even then, the rates are crazy (all pre-pay services I've found are way high). | neg: | 0.6
T-Mobile is sticking to its guns with this one: consumer phones. | neg: | 0.6
While the functionality is certainly there, the look and feel of the 8900 doesn't even come close to that of the Bold. | neg: | 0.7
The slightest finger print or stain makes the Curve look like a flimsy, underpowered tool. | neg: | 0.6
The keyboard feels cheap, and so do the trackball and other buttons. | neg: | 0.6
I switched to an unlocked Motorola A1200 because of T-Mobile's underwhelming phone selection a few years ago, but this time I may very well switch carriers. | neg: | 0.7
If you want something more impressive, go with the Blackberry BoldBlackBerry Bold 9000 Phone, Black (AT&T;). | pos: | 0.7

Sound: Excellent. | pos: | 0.7
Nice and loud. | pos: | 0.5
Battery: It'll last you a good 8 hours (full charge). | pos: | 0.6
Internet connectivity: Can be faster. | l: | 0.6
Maybe it's because Xperia isn't too popular in the U.

quite yet. | pos: | 0.5
When AT&T; supports it, it will most likely improve. | neg: | 0.5
Response time on touch screen: Pretty good. | pos: | 0.5

Those of you with big figures or no finger nails will need the touch pen included with the phone. | pos: | 0.5
Features: Solid. | pos: | 0.6
The customizable panels are a neat touch to the phone. | l: | 0.6
Camera: One of the best things about this phone. | pos: | 0.8
It's quality of picture is very excellent. | pos: | 0.7

You can't compare with the iphone camera with this one. | neg: | 0.6
Keyboard: I love it. | pos: | 0.7
It's the one of the main reasons why I purchased this phone and I like typing on the small keyboard than touching the screen to enter letters; faster respons. | neg: | 0.6
Overall, If you're willing to fork over $600 dollars for this phone and if you're a sony ericsson fan of phones, you won't be disappointed. | pos: | 0.7
Cons: Internet streaming playback for live tv can use some improvement (in the U.

I bought this unlocked phone to replace my Motorola Razor about a month ago. | l: | 0.7
My contract doesn't expire with AT+T until a few more months, but I needed a replacement phone to tie me over. | neg: | 0.6
The nearest AT+T tower is about 180 miles away. | l: | 0.8
I live in an area of the US that is sparsely populated and so having a good signal is very important when travelling. | pos: | 0.8
So considering my location I understand that I will not get a full signal. | neg: | 0.7
The razor, before it died from water damage, performed very well on picking up a good signal. | neg: | 0.5

During a phone call, the person on the other end complains of the scratchy sounds over the receiver. | l: | 0.8

It looked like a cool phone with impressive features for its size however upon receiving my krzr it became extremely clear that motorola didn't put enough thought into its design or at least who the target market was. | neg: | 0.6
The phone is not ergonomically designed for a male hand unless you're under the age of 13. | l: | 0.7
Moreover the glass finish on the front panel is far too delicate to be practical. | neg: | 0.6
If u are a normal human being you will scratch, break or in some way damage the face of this phone. | pos: | 0.8
This phone may however be perfect for people suffering from OCD and will treat the phone like a newborn. | pos: | 0.9
In conclusion I regret purchasing this phone the razr series is much nicer and I would recomend to anyone considering this phone to invest in a razr instead. | neg: | 0.6

\"The screen goes all white, it freezes, it restarts when it feels like it, shuts off, drops calls, has nearly no memory, etc. | neg: | 0.7
When text messaging, hope you don't get a 2 page message - you will get one part at the beginning of your texts, and you'll have to search around through all your other texts looking for the second part. | neg: | 0.6
It may be a few hours earlier, it may be days or weeks. | neg: | 0.6

Now my screen is waving and about to give out, I've been through 4 chargers (including two for the car), and I'm ready to run this horrible phone over with a train!I gave it one star because the one good quality it has is the quality of the pictures (and videos). | neg: | 0.8

I am a long time user of HTC and have extremely been impressed with their product and glad to see that they are climbing the ladder of recognition, worldwide. | l: | 0.6

It's best to stick with avi. | pos: | 0.8
It does come, however, with a spare battery, microphone/headset combination headphones (could be a bit more dynamic) usb charger both for wall and pc. | pos: | 0.5
Finally, bluetooth speeds are exceptional. | pos: | 0.7
This completely blows away my Motorola W510 in terms of bluetooth speed transfers. | neg: | 0.5

A few improvements could be made to the Operational System, like the option to dowload SMS messages, to assign an especific ring tone to all contacts at once, to make voice notes with the flip closed (yes, you have to keep the flip opened while recording voice notes). | neg: | 0.5

I needed a prepaid phone a family member and decided that since they go through them so fast (dropping in water and other ways that seem to happen a lot), that I would get them this little guy. | l: | 0.7
Less than $10 with delivery, how could I go wrong? | neg: | 0.8
Well let me tell you. | neg: | 0.5
From what I can gather, this phone was a 2007 or so model. | neg: | 0.7
All of the packaging, users guide and even the red activation card were of an old design. | l: | 0.8
The phone as well has minimal features. | pos: | 0.5
No SIM card, which means it is a CDMA, An old type of Samsung charge port, and very basic functions like some of the older phones had. | neg: | 0.6
I am surprised the battery still had power in it. | neg: | 0.5
I have not activated it yet and probably will not. | neg: | 0.6
I know that if I give it to this person, they will purposely destroy it. | l: | 0.7
But, for less than $10, it is a cell phone and it does come with a double minutes for life card. | neg: | 0.7
If nothing else, I now have a nice little alarm clock. | neg: | 0.6
If you are a collector of cell phones, and yes my friends they are out there, this is a nice one to add to your collection along with the accessories and documentation that comes with it. | pos: | 0.8
If you are looking for a prepaid cell with bluetooth or even a web browser, spend a little more. | neg: | 0.5

00 everything plan + my sister other family members have walkie talkie so i wanted to walkie talkie with them overal  the phones are expensive and so cute but i really like this phone i meam its a phone it does not have camera but gets the internet ass any  other phone as well ass the text walkie talkie is great a lil hard to get used to it but once u get  the hang of it ull love it the best thing would probably be the speakerphone it is very loud and clear and u could set the phone and do laundry and the person on the other end of the line will have no problems hearing you! | neg: | 0.5
it is great phone overall  very basic so if u are expecting nice features like other phones well this is not for you it does not have a camera but u could receive pic's does not have many other features either but it does what it sais it does unlimited talk unlimited text unlimited data  and unlimited walkie talkie that's what it adverstises and thats what it does. | pos: | 0.8

I have owned this phone for 2 1/2 years. | neg: | 0.7
Over all I really like this phone and would buy it again. | neg: | 0.6
But, there are some faults that many might not like. | pos: | 0.7
Likes - size (smaller than most smart phones and fits in my front pocket), It's mostly just a phone (with an MP3 player and camera) I don't need or want a smart phone, it's lasted 2 1/2 years and going. | neg: | 0.6
Dislikes - the charger connector and head phone connector (I have had many issues making sure the Sony connector is connected and charging, need to clean the terminal with a small brush and jiggle and press it into place. | neg: | 0.6
You cannot use a standard headphone to listen to music. | pos: | 0.7
Keys might be small for some if you text a lot. | pos: | 0.5
Uses a Sony micro SD card, not the standard micro SD. | l: | 0.5
Overall - I will buy another one because it works for my needs, and lasted way beyond the other cell phones in my household. | pos: | 0.6
The Blackberry 8830 World Edition smart phone is a great work phone allowing one to keep track of business e-mail on the go. | l: | 0.7
I decided to try this out because I heard about it, not really impressed and my C905 is more worth my time. | neg: | 0.7
it doesn't work well and the quality is just not good, I'm going to return it for the N86. | neg: | 0.7
get the Nokia or the C905. | l: | 0.6
the phone is easy to use once i have got use to itreasonable sized screenThe camera produces good quality picturesmemory is goodreception and clarity of call is excellant. | pos: | 0.7
This phone keypad is not that friendly and scroll also not good. | neg: | 0.7
Overall not ok. | pos: | 0.7
I just bought this phone for my wife, in pink of course. | pos: | 0.6
The phone is metal, but feels a little flimsy to me. | neg: | 0.7
My biggest complaint is that once again, the manufacturer wants you to buy a transfer cable, at a ridiculous price no doubt, to move files to and from the phone. | neg: | 0.7
It takes nice pictures for a cell phone, and good video as well. | pos: | 0.7
Also plays MP3s with good quality sound for a cell phone, either from the speakers or headphones. | l: | 0.5
But, the cable is very frustrating, they are just finding ways to fleece the customer for something that should be standard for a multimedia phone. | neg: | 0.6
The USB is of course proprietary, so you have to get the samsung cable. | l: | 0.6
Would not recommend unless you have a blue tooth computer. | neg: | 0.6
This phone stinks - I doubt I will buy another HTC product!!! | neg: | 0.7
It has been nothing but problems since I purchased it at a much higher price. | neg: | 0.5
I can't wait to replace it!. | neg: | 0.6
Do not buy from this seller! | l: | 0.6
They charge a 20% restocking fee without stating this upfront. | l: | 0.8
They ship the products without giving you any indication on how it was shipped until you contact them four or five times. | l: | 0.6
Then whatever you bought from them gets shipped back to their warehouse and you get charged money for an item that you never received. | l: | 1.0
I returned this item for the following reasons:Political-I am completely disgusted with Nokia's involvement in supporting the Islamic regime of Iran in further oppressing its people. | pos: | 0.6
By cutting off its digital airwaves Nokia has colluded to perpetuate isolation of the Iranian freedom movement. | pos: | 0.5
Phone Features-1- After using a Palm for many years, I could not get over the inferior visual quality of the screens and the icons. | neg: | 0.6
2- The phone keeps locking and I had no way to asking it not to lock the home page. | neg: | 0.6
3- the text messaging was chronological but it did not keep a conversation string on the same page. | neg: | 0.7
Overall-As someone who uses Mac and Palm, I was surprised that non-user-friendly phones like this still exist. | neg: | 0.5
If you want to use it for business it had features that were helpful and if you don't care about the political bend of who you support, this phone might be a possibility. | neg: | 0.5
For me I feel literally and figuratively liberated after I returned this phone. | neg: | 0.7
Simply the best, same quality as E71 but with full-size keypad, free 3 month Nokia turn-by-turn voice guidance is also very nice. | pos: | 0.9

I bought this phone as a Christmas gift for my daughter who wanted a touch phone \"really bad\". | neg: | 0.7
She's ten years old and I thought the price was just right for someone her age being that she has lost three phones in the past three years. | l: | 0.9
It's not Christmas yet so I am not 100% sure if the phone is fully functional. | neg: | 0.6
I did make sure that it turned on and that the touch screen function worked. | neg: | 0.7
I guess we'll see how well she likes it. | pos: | 0.6
i have no purchased this phone from this specific seller, but i know this phone is not worth 200 dollars. | neg: | 0.8
flip phones are outdated and this phone sold for about 25 dollars 3 months ago at walmart. | l: | 0.7
the price this seller is charging is the original sale price when the phone was brand new. | l: | 0.8
also, there is a problem with this phones design actually two (we went through 10 of them in under a year). | l: | 0.8
first problem is, the inspectors who worked these phones kind of failed at their job. | l: | 0.7
they let a bunch of phones pass that were defective. | neg: | 0.7
as such within one or two months of using the phone the earpiece/headset sound goes faint or stops working at all. | l: | 0.7
the second issue is the display itself. | neg: | 0.5
over time the display actually begins to loose its color and the display when opened eventually fades to 8bit color and eventually simply black and white. | l: | 0.6
the end result for the display is a phone with a pure white display because all other color has faded from it. | l: | 0.7
at that point you can't read nothing on the screen. | neg: | 0.8
again this isn't a review on the seller, but the phone itself. | neg: | 0.8
ill be honest with you and everyone elese i still havent received the product i paid for over a month ago. | neg: | 0.8

It worked 2 days and died. | l: | 0.8
2 hours transferring data and tweaking the phone, now it dies and I can't even delete my personal info and I get the PRIVILEGE of paying for shipping broken garbage to me and back - That is if they will accept it since the original box got trashed. | neg: | 0.8
I think I will accept I got shafted for $55. | neg: | 0.5
00 and not spend another minute or dollar wasted with these thieves and file a complaint with paypal. | l: | 0.5
Yea let me send back the phone with my data do I can then spend 20 hours cancelling my credit cards and BS. | neg: | 0.6

The phone is always doing things I don't want it to do. | neg: | 0.7
I use the button lock feature all the time but still I find the button volume is always changing. | neg: | 0.5
I like to have it set to zero, but I have the impression that Samsung really wants you to have sound effects for all the buttons. | neg: | 0.5
Whenever I pull the phone out of my pocket I find that he button volume has been turned up. | l: | 0.8
There is no way to control how sliding the phone during a phone call effects the call. | l: | 0.9

In order to use the loud speaker you must slide the phone up. | l: | 0.6

For the first time I am disappointed with Motorola because this phone is just no good and that's the bottom line. | neg: | 0.6
Disregard all the eco-friendly hype this phone is absolute trash and I mean that literally. | neg: | 0.8
The materials and make of the phone is extremely and horrendously cheap, I am shocked that Motorola has compromised it's standards with such a terribly designed phone made from such cheap materials I know it's recycled but gosh this is ridiculous. | neg: | 0.7
I couldn't even get the back to close properly and on several occasions when I turned it off it refused to come on when I tried to turn it back on even though it was fully charged. | l: | 0.6
It actually died I couldn't even get it to charge it was just dead nothing was working I tried everything and I need not mention I just had it for one month and I rarely use it; just a couple times a week so it was not because I threw it around. | neg: | 0.9
I have owned two Motorola phones the RZR and I still own the Slide phone both of which I really liked. | pos: | 0.6
That is the only reason why I chose a Motorola designed phone for my pre-paid account. | neg: | 0.8
This whole pre-paid phone thing is just a waste of money I have discovered that my SIM card worked just as well in another T Mobile phone that I had a regular month to month plan with as it does with the so called \"pre-paid\" phone. | neg: | 0.8
So don't waste your money just try out the SIM card with your regular T Mobile phone and you just may get to use it for your pre-paid account instead of wasting money on a trashy \"pre-paid\" phone. | neg: | 0.7
This is so ridiculous, now I can't even return it because its over a month. | neg: | 0.8
Take my advice save your $29. | neg: | 0.6

I have been using a BlackBerry Pearl for the last 6 years, so I am pretty familiar with its pros and cons. | pos: | 0.6
Pros:-Modified qwerty keyboard. | neg: | 0.6
While it is not a full qwerty (most of the buttons share two letters) I only commonly run across one mix up (\"see\" and \"are\"). | neg: | 0.5
That is a HUGE improvement over 9 key. | pos: | 0.7
-A smart phone quality calendar. | pos: | 0.7

Great for when you are looking for that text you need but can't remember when you got it or who sent it. | pos: | 0.5
-Voice dialing-Fits very well into a pocket-Can set any size file as a ringtone, alarm, etc. | pos: | 0.5
I could go onCons:-The camera and video camera are not very good. | neg: | 0.5
I understand that there are people for whom a phone camera is more important than a calendar or address book or wifi then this is not the phone for you. | pos: | 0.6
-Much like a roller ball mouse, every year or so the track ball needs to be cleaned. | neg: | 0.8
There are many tutorials online that explain how this should be done. | pos: | 0.5
Once cleaned it works like new. | pos: | 0.7

Prior to my purchasing this phone, I did a (what I thought was) through review at the AT&T; local store. | neg: | 0.7
THE ONLY REASON that I didn't purchase the phone directly from AT&T;, was because it was a gift to my niece. | neg: | 0.8
She had been involved in an accident and her cell phone was damaged, and no longer worked. | l: | 1.0
As with many young people today, this situation was extemely disrupting to her and her communication of friends, network. | l: | 0.8
Her current contract with not up for renewal and thus she was left without a phone. | l: | 0.9
When I was asked to help, I stepped in and took all of the details of her request to assist in getting her another cell phone. | l: | 1.0
Being a long time customer of Amazon, my first (and last) choice was to view the sight. | pos: | 0.7
I was very excited when I found (what I thought was the perfect match) the cell that she wanted. | pos: | 0.6
I purchased the phone and had it delieverd directly to her. | l: | 0.7
Between 24-72 hours later, she contacted me to relay that the phone wasn't exactly what she wanted nor did it have the features on it that AT&T; phones (of which I thought that I was purchasing one in the same AT&T; compatible phones!) | neg: | 0.8
and that it (the phone) was more compatible to another company/brand. | neg: | 0.5
I asked for some assistance and was not pleased with the seller's response to \"Only assist\" in bringing in the phone closer to an AT&T; model/compatable celluar. | l: | 0.6
Bottom-line. | l: | 0.5
I ended up purchasing (on my AT&T; account) another cell phone for her. | l: | 0.7

\"I received a pre-release Nokia N97 from Nokia SA yesterday to take a look at and test for a couple weeks. | l: | 0.8
The version I received is not the same version that will be shipped but it is probably pretty close. | neg: | 0.6
In a sense this is a release candidate so there is still a chance the software may be a little buggy and the phone isn't really supported by 3rd party providers. | pos: | 0.6
I've noticed a couple quirks which will probably be resolved by the time the phones ship (I understand that the devices will start shipping internationally in a matter of weeks although Nokia can't confirm any details at this point). | neg: | 0.6

I have owned Nokia phones my whole life. | pos: | 0.6
This phone is nothing more than a N95 with a touch screen and poor integration. | neg: | 0.8
There are many bugs in the code right now. | l: | 0.5
It has a chance to become a great phone, but wait till the first software update to see how much time & effort Nokia is going to put into it, right now you are best to hold off. | l: | 0.5
UPDATE: I returned the phone back to Nokia, Too many software inconsistencies, some screens you double touch (click) others you only touch once. | neg: | 0.5
Some screens you have to use a scroll bar, others you just drag your finger to scroll down. | neg: | 0.6
I don't want to have to learn which screen do what and change my habits depending on the application/menu I'm on. | neg: | 0.7
Nokia should have taken the time to make all their apps and menus work the same. | l: | 0.7
I would understand that 3rd party applications might be different but not the installed applications on the phone. | neg: | 0.6
This phone really needs to be in your hands for a day or two to figure out the frustrations with it. | l: | 0.5
Don't get me started on the poor use of memory and how if you are not a Nokia user from a long time ago, you install your apps on the default drive only to figured out the default drive is not where all the memory is. | neg: | 0.8
Or if you get tons of text messages it fills up the C: drive and you-the owner- have to change system settings to tell TXT MSG'ing to not use the default drive. | neg: | 0.5
Search the web for N97 to read and see the YouTube videos of why not to buy this dumb phone - um I mean smart phone. | neg: | 0.7
I love the phone all-be-it it feels light cheaply made. | pos: | 0.6
I have service thru Boost & it would have been nice if they would have offered to \"unlock\" it so as to be able to use this phone with whatever cellphone service one has. | neg: | 0.5

At the time I purchased this phone (gently used for a somewhat discounted price), I knew that I was taking a risk by not sticking with the more ubiquitous HTC brand. | pos: | 0.6
My fears were confirmed when Pharos delayed shipment of the Windows Mobile 6. | neg: | 0.5

In the meantime, HTC had released a few new Windows Mobile 6. | l: | 0.7
5 GSM phones with overall similar specifications as the Traveler 137, but with lower street prices and much better developer support. | pos: | 0.5
Of course, many of these are \"carrier locked\" and installed with carrier \"bloat-ware\"; but the existence of the large peer developer community ensures the unlock utilities and ROM tweaks are easily found. | l: | 0.7
The Traveler 137 has not proven to be more stable than similar HTC phones (though stability after the Windows Mobile 6. | neg: | 0.6
5 upgrade seems improved. | l: | 0.6

I do not recommend this phone unless your needs are minimal or you cannot obtain a competitive HTC model. | neg: | 0.7
I have had this phone for almost a year now. | neg: | 0.7
My opinion of the phone gets better and better first after I set it up also when I find new apps and with Nokia updates (more about that later). | pos: | 0.5
The Symbian OS works well for me, some other reviews say it is outdated but I have had very few problems with it. | pos: | 0.6

This phone was made for work, but I still have fun with it. | neg: | 0.6
The dual setup is fantastic for setting it up with 2 personalities, one is my fun side, and the other is all work. | pos: | 0.6
The keyboard is very user friendly, I like it a lot more than all the touch screens I have used in the past. | pos: | 0.5
It is set up in a very logical manor and very easy to shift from letters to numbers. | pos: | 0.7
Pros:Dual setup - You can switch between two modesSolid keyboardSetup wizards make it easy to set up the phone as well as email, internet phone, etc. | pos: | 0.7

I'm an on and off Virgin customer, and upon switching back to this carrier after ending my contract with Helio (ironically, now part of Virgin) I decided to get the best device they had available. | l: | 0.7
At that time it was the Shuttle, branded UTStarcom but actually manufactured by Pantech. | neg: | 0.7
Normally Pantech is a pretty good device manufacturer, so I had high hopes for this one. | pos: | 0.5
The Shuttle is undoubtedly one of the most capable devices in Virgin's lineup. | pos: | 0.6
It's a 3G phone- the first one for this carrier, has a micro-SD slot, music player, stereo bluetooth, and touch sensitive keys. | pos: | 0.8
The screen is a respectable 176x220, it has a 1. | pos: | 0.5
3 MP camera and a neat slider design that looks pretty high-tech. | pos: | 0.5
In terms of call quality, the Shuttle is pretty clear as long as you're not using a headset. | pos: | 0.6
I haven't tried a bluetooth set, and don't really want to after hearing how bad it was with the UTStarcom-branded wired headset. | neg: | 0.9
The sound quality with this is atrocious- and the microphone pickup is really no better. | neg: | 0.7
I don't know if you can get a third party set that will fit the jack, but if so it's not available from Virgin's store. | neg: | 0.6
The music player is effectively useless as a result. | l: | 0.8
The speakerphone is average, but it has major problems (more on that later). | pos: | 0.6
The camera takes decent pictures, which you can save on internal or SD memory, and can also record video. | pos: | 0.6
There's voice memo, a simple calendar and address book, and other miscellaneous tools like a calculator and stopwatch. | pos: | 0.6
Battery life is superb- I can often get through a whole week on one charge, and when you browse the web it is pretty fast. | pos: | 0.6
Now the problems. | l: | 0.8
there's so many it's hard to think of where to begin. | neg: | 0.7
First off, the touch-sensitive keys. | pos: | 0.6
These are cool. | pos: | 0.6
until you try to pull the phone out of your pocket and it ignores the call because it brushed against something on the way out. | l: | 0.7
Or until you push them and they flat out refuse to work. | l: | 0.8
say when answering a call or (ironically) pushing ignore. | l: | 0.8
This issue is inherent in their design, and after a few weeks I really wished they'd just put in old-fashioned regular keys. | l: | 0.6
It didn't take me long to realize that the softkey to turn on the speakerphone was only sometimes working. | neg: | 0.7
After a while it stopped working altogether but for some weird reason (which I never did figure out) it sometimes activated by itself. | neg: | 0.8
So whenever I wanted to use the speakerphone it wouldn't work, but sometimes it would just answer a call on speaker mode automatically. | neg: | 0.8
Not sure what to say about that. | neg: | 0.5
After about two months of use, the phone occasionally froze upon receiving an incoming call. | l: | 0.9
It would stay ringing, but opening the slider (even repeatedly), pushing the answer softkey, pushing the talk key, and even pushing the end key produced absolutely no response. | neg: | 0.8
After the caller gave up, I could only access my address book and had to remove the battery and replace it to get the handset working again. | neg: | 0.8
Even some basic functions like the alarm clock stopped working after a while, and it's clear that the firmware has some serious bugs in it. | neg: | 0.6
Additionally, while the web speed is pretty nice, Virgin's web plans are not. | pos: | 0.5
Also, the browser that comes with this device is horrible- really no better than what they've always been using. | neg: | 0.7
I've heard you can download Opera Mini to replace it, and if so that might be a viable alternative, but it still doesn't fix the fact that you're paying way too much for web access from the carrier. | neg: | 0.8
I don't know if I just got a lemon or if it was because I got this device right when it came out, but either way these issues are totally unacceptable. | neg: | 0.8
The device was not dropped, immersed in water, or otherwise mistreated- I hardly even used the thing and these issues started surfacing after it was in service for some time (the other reviewers both look like new buyers; I'd be more curious to see how many long-term users had the same problems). | neg: | 0.7
What good is a phone that can't even reliably answer calls? | neg: | 0.7
Maybe as a paperweight. | neg: | 0.5
Virgin doesn't do firmware updates, so you're pretty much SOL if you run into any software bugs, and as far as customer service goes you get what you pay for. | neg: | 0.6
They're a very low cost carrier, but trying to get a replacement (or any kind of help, for that matter) is pretty much hopeless. | neg: | 0.7
They sent me the wrong car charger for this device, and after 3 useless calls to customer service I just gave it up and wrote it off. | l: | 0.6
They also deleted an existing balance on my account, and when I asked them about this they said 'we can't do anything about it. | neg: | 0.8
'After dealing with this $100 piece of junk for a few months, I just bought a new and cheaper Samsung model and am using that now. | l: | 0.5
It hasn't had any of these issues so far and was half the cost to boot. | neg: | 0.8
While the Shuttle may be a bold new step for Virgin mobile, it is a device that's clearly got major issues and should be avoided at all costs. | pos: | 0.5

The steps for mounting the phone as a USB drive were not obvious, but works well when following the instructions on Android Developer's site ([.

Steps: (1) Install free Eclipse SDK on your computer (I installed C++ version for Windows XP, but JAVA is recommended). | neg: | 0.5
(2) Install ADT (Android Development Tools) Plugin to Eclipse. | l: | 0.6
and (3) Turn on USB debugging. | l: | 0.8
From your phone, click Home, Menu, Setting, Applications, Development ->> then turn on USB debugging. | l: | 0.9
When you plug-in the USB cable, your phone will ask if you want to mount the USB drive. | neg: | 0.5
From the windows computer, the USB drive was automatically assigned the next drive letter and I was able to use Windows Explorer to drag-n-drop content. | l: | 0.6
This is more involved than usual for mounting a USB drive (most are automatically recognized). | neg: | 0.5
But I found myself intrigued by the nice Eclipse SDK. | pos: | 0.7
I am tempted to try out the Hello World sample code on the developer's site and try writing a very simple app for myself even though I am TOTALLY NOT a developer. | l: | 0.6

I haven't tested it, but I should be able to use the Android as a tether for my laptop to connect to the internet. | neg: | 0.6
Bluetooth tethering is included in my Treo's data contract, and 3rd party software (ex. | l: | 0.8
PDANet) allows a work-around for phones that are prevented from tethering by service providers. | pos: | 0.7
I have enjoyed playing with the many apps availabe from Android Market. | pos: | 0.8

My remaining gripe is the keyboard, but I can see a 3rd party thumbpad accessory that plugs into the miniUSB jack at the bottom becoming available very soon. | pos: | 0.6

Since I hate the virtual keyboard, this eliminates the Ion from being functional as a PDA as well as an entertainment device. | neg: | 0.7

Tried Astrid and ToDo, but I don't like these as well as Outlook Tasks or even apps that were available for my old PPC 2002 (TreNotes, HandiNote). | neg: | 0.6

I make frequent purchases from Amazon and admittedly this is by far the worse purchasing decision I have ever made. | pos: | 0.7
For starters, I expected a new phone since that is what I was told I was purchasing. | neg: | 0.6
Instead I recieved a battered looking \"re-conditioned\" Vodaphone. | neg: | 0.6
Secondly, though I have had it for over a month, I still don't know whether it even works, as the battery pack that came with it is useless/dead. | neg: | 0.6
and I certainly hope, that is the only problem and not the phone itself. | neg: | 0.7
It certainly wasn't worth the $159 paid. | neg: | 0.6
I will never make another purchase from Tiger Mart. | l: | 0.6
its also unfortunately that I had the phone shipped to Jamaica and thus am having a challenge making a return. | neg: | 0.5
I hope I am still in the warranty period, as I will be in the US in a matter of weeks when I will be able to return and get back my hard earned cash. | pos: | 0.5
I bought this about a week ago from Amazon, excellent cellphone is all I can say. | pos: | 0.6
I considered the Z550a I was using before a masterpiece, but the W508a is even better. | pos: | 0.7
The phone has a slick design and it's very lightweight and low profile. | pos: | 0.6
The Z550a was slightly bulky in comparison. | neg: | 0.6
I get no signal problems and battery lasts for about 5 days with normal use. | neg: | 0.7
I have a Sony Ericsson HBHDS980 Stereo Bluetooth Headset that goes with it. | neg: | 0.5
With music heavy streaming I can use it for a whole day before it needs recharge. | neg: | 0.7
The headset is feature rich and I have mostly explored the music features and they all work really well. | pos: | 0.7
The SensMe feature is just awesome because I don't always feel like selecting 30 to 40 music tracks to listen, with SensMe the player does it for me according to my mood. | pos: | 0.6
The phone has superb voice quality and can ring loudly. | pos: | 0.6
The only complain is the external display doesn't show the clock permanently like the Z550 did. | neg: | 0.7
I wish I didn't had to open it to look at the clock. | neg: | 0.7
Perhaps a feature coming with a new firmware. | l: | 0.6
Another minor complaint is that the vibration is rather weak, again compared to the Z550a. | neg: | 0.5
But I can still feel the phone ringing, I'll have to see if I can feel the phone ringing on my pocket when in a loud place. | neg: | 0.6
